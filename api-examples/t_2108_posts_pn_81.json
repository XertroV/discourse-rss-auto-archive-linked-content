If you’re interested in kids, maybe you should discuss those topics. I’d be happy to have more feedback/discussion about parenting. Besides TCS criticism, I also wrote about good parenting principles/approaches.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Yes and I’ve read 1 of 3 of the linked posts at the end. Discussing more is something I’d plan to do when in a position to have kids (i.e., long term relationship). Maybe I should be doing a bit of that sooner, though, because it might matter for who I get into a relationship with. For example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Parents can be more influential than culture by keeping their children extremely isolated, but they shouldn’t. Merely homeschooling and being anti-social isn’t even close to isolating enough. I mean more like being in a cult or living off-grid with the children not having internet access or any friends with internet access.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am concerned about culture and one idea I’ve thought about as a hypothetical is establishing communities for parents so that there can be reasonable insulation from mainstream culture especially at younger ages without foregoing decent socialization. Regarding technology, an incremental approach might work, particularly introducing tech in an old-to-new way rather than few-screen-hours-to-many. Putting aside all the issues with this like cost and difficulty, it’s an example of something that (if I were going to attempt that) would be good to figure out before finding someone to have children with because she might not agree or like that idea.</p>",

Re chess particularly, some of the issues we’ve talked about motivate separate leagues. Are you saying that having separate leagues based only on the idea that there is some relevant difference between sexes is a bad idea? Otherwise it seems like this conclusion kind of contradicts other ones, so I’m not sure what to make of it.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"anonymous105\" data-post=\"70\" data-topic=\"2108\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/a/8797f3/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> anonymous105:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Should there be an Autistic League?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>I don’t think so (as an official thing, that is, side events or whatever are fine) but there are other reasons for that, too. Like would you have 2 leagues for slightly autistic people and severely autistic? What are the breakpoints? There isn’t really an equivalent for this problem with sex, one can’t be twice the maleness of someone else, for example. You could try and quantify it in terms of gender expression but that seems way too fragile and error prone to be viable in any serious way (which I suppose is why the ‘a woman is someone who identifies as a woman’ thing is popular).<br>\nAs a note, I think dealing with intersex is different to dealing with the autism spectrum.

Chess has youth tournaments with different sections for grade level ranges (e.g. kids in grades 6-8 play together) in addition to a gender split. Adult chess has tournaments with sections based on rating, like only people rated under 1400 can play in this section, and under 1600 for the next section up, etc. No gender split is needed with the rating-based sections. Ratings are based on past performance so they’re just literally trying to group people together by how good they are to get closer games. Cash prizes in lower sections aren’t huge but can be over $1000. Sandbagging (losing games in one event to get a low rating in order to win another event) doesn’t happen a ton as far as I know since the stakes aren’t very high, plus there exist some rules to put a floor on how far your rating can fall.</p>\n<p>Sometimes some really strong young chess players choose not to play in grade-level based tournaments that they could easily win. It wouldn’t be good competition and often the only prize is a trophy. So that also helps keep things competitive.</p>\n<p>If a really strong chess player does play against weaker players, the weaker players often like the opportunity to meet and play against someone really impressive. It’s common to have special events (that aren’t competitive tournaments, just for fun) where strong players play against like 30 weaker players at once as a way to let them have a fun time playing someone better than they usually play against and meeting someone impressive. The strong player just walks in a circle around the room playing a move then going to the next board.</p>\n<p>Recently one of the top 10 players in the world, Hikaru Nakamura, went and played in the open section at a regional tournament (the Louisiana State Championship) that was way beneath him. He played some people rated far, far below him. The second highest rated player in the tournament was objectively a very strong player but still not very competitive with a top 10 player. Some people on the internet complained about how unfair it was, but multiple people he beat were thrilled for the chance to meet and play one of the most famous and talented names in chess, and people were happy he came and visited their relatively small, local tournament.</p>\n<p>Why did he do it? The prizes were too small for him to care and he can get better practice or competition online. He just needed to play enough rated games this year (while maintaining his high rating) to qualify for the tournament that qualifies you to compete to be world champion. Playing against weaker opponents was safer for him than playing in a more competitive tournament. The incentives here are dumb, but that is the fault of FIDE, the main international chess organization, and similar things have already happened multiple times in past years. Unlike most other top chess pros, Nakamura doesn’t play a lot of rated games because he’s a full time Twitch streamer and YouTuber who makes great money that way, yet he’s still been performing well in top tournaments when he does play.</p>",

I can explain but it might be good to think it through yourself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>I didn’t. I have a guess after thinking about it (and having read some other posts further down). I’ll go through your suggested questions first.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is the best argument for excluding trans women from professional women’s sports?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think this is related to the origin of women’s sports in general so I’ll start there.</p>\n<p>The reason for having women’s sports at all is intrinsic differences between the sexes which can lead to: injury and/or a competitive environment in which it is much harder for exceptional women to be recognized. For an example of the second point: tennis. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/cb4iru/if_serena_williams_competed_with_the_men_what/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">some relevant discussion from reddit</a>.</p>\n<p>Including trans women in women’s sports directly goes against both those goals. For contact sports, the risk is obvious, especially for m2f that transition after puberty. For other sports like tennis, it directly harms the second goal. That is the best argument I think.</p>\n<p>Another thought, if we want thinks like girls to have sporting role models, having a separate women’s league helps that. However, having a woman succeed at a high level outside of a women’s league is probably even better for role models and aspirations. Chess might be a good example where this kind of general success is possible without any issues.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What specific, objectively verifiable biological advantages do trans women have over cis women in sports?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The tallest are taller, the strongest are stronger, etc. (Possibly: the smartest are smarter but I’ll comment more on that later)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do these advantages exist in all sports equally?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No, the advantages are almost always specific to the sport. There are sports where women might have advantages, too, though I’m less confident about guessing which. Some guesses: gymnastics, diving, dancing. Things where being flexible, light, or slight help. There are maybe some exceptions to that, like I don’t know why more jockeys aren’t female considering being light is an advantage.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One thing that might also help is to not think about trans women as “identical to a typical man, but in a dress” for the purpose of this thought experiment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Trans women come in all shapes and sizes so I’m not sure why this matters much if we’re considering the top-tier competitors. There are plenty of trans women that individually don’t have a substantial advantage in that many of their relevant attributes might be phenotypical of women. I don’t think this matters much because the tallest trans women are likely to be taller than the tallest women; same for strongest, fastest, etc.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>what might be some reasons women would choose to participate in women’s sports instead of mixed gender sports?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Perceived fairness, more fun at higher levels, reaching higher levels, avoid injury, socializing, higher relative chance of doing well (e.g., making top X), social pressure or similar.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do those reasons vary from sport to sport?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes. They depend on the sport.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Where does chess fit in?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The main reasons I’d guess apply are: fairness, reaching higher levels, and social pressure / latent sexism.</p>\n<p>The first two are maybe controversial and depend on something like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variability_hypothesis\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Variability hypothesis</a> applying components of intelligence that are relevant to chess.</p>\n<p>Going back to the main question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do you see how bringing up gendered chess leagues actually works against your position (and the anti-trans position in general) in this topic?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My position as it related to chess was “Even something like chess would crowd a lot of women out if it were combined” in reference to a mixed league “not [making] sense”. I’m not sure that’s what you meant by “[my] position” though. I’ll discuss it anyway and the anti-trans position generally after.</p>\n<p>In hindsight my view is a bit different to this: mixed leagues are often fine and good, but having a dedicated women’s league is also good. I was considering particularly the idea of foregoing women’s leagues in favor of mixed, rather than having mixed + women’s. Technically having all 3 (including men’s) would be good but in many cases I think that could make factors like sexism worse (e.g., all male chess players just play in the men’s instead of mixed and latent sexism continues). Most of the time men’s leagues seem to act like mixed leagues anyway, so having mixed + women’s seems like the most appropriate.</p>\n<p>My main objection to mixed leagues is where there’s a big physical disparity that increases the risk of injury. i.e., combat and contact sports.</p>\n<p>With regards to chess particularly, I think having a women’s league is important assuming there is some innate difference between the sexes in the distribution of top players (e.g., as predicted by the variability hypothesis). It also matters in things like tournament structure if we care about finding the best female players because tournament structures seem to be more accurate near the top. (It probably doesn’t or shouldn’t matter for ranking scores like elo. It would be interesting if there were significant differences between elo distributions in womens-only vs mixed, after accounting for any population distribution differences.)</p>\n<p>Also regarding chess, I think latent sexism as in <a href=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/t/comments-on-the-boyfriends-introduction-to-feminism/2108/67\">Elliot’s first paragraph</a> are a reason not to have women’s leagues, or at least make mixed leagues the default. Maybe that’s too much but I think that kind of sexism is bad but I don’t know what else to do about it besides like proactive encouragement by organizers or penalizing players, both of which I don’t think will necessarily make that much of a difference. With regards to other benefits of women’s leagues like role models, it’s not clear what would be better.</p>\n<p>Regarding the general anti-trans position as related to chess, my concern is that men/males will on the whole dominate the higher tiers. Something like 10:1. I am already part of an e-sport community where the women’s league was won (undefeated) by a trans team. It feels unfair.</p>\n<p>The guess I mentioned earlier was to do with an assumption that the variability hypothesis was wrong or irrelevant for chess, plus the latent sexism stuff. But now that I’ve written the above out I am not sure how it goes against the anti-trans position, except in that it might advocate for mixed-by-default.</p>\n<p>IDK, I’m not sure I really see it or where to go from here. Do you mind explaining what you meant? Hopefully the above helps you with things to point to explicitly.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Sorry for not replying as much as I earlier indicated that I would. I have acquired a head cold.</p>",

Even something like chess would crowd a lot of women out if it were combined. (Also it’s usually allowed for women to compete in men’s leagues, just they don’t perform well most of the time).</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>When women (the Polgar sisters) have performed well in open chess tournaments, they have been discriminated against and pressured to go play in women’s tournaments instead. They’ve been denied grandmaster titles when meeting the criteria to earn them. There has been sexism in the chess world, not a welcoming attitude towards any woman capable of competing with the top men. (Of course reactions vary. Some people have been more welcoming than others.)</p>\n<p>Also I used to watch Jennifer Shahade as part of the commentary team for chess tournaments. I’ll tell you two things about that:</p>\n<p>Shahade normally commentated on a team with two men. Just as with other types of TV teams, different people have different roles. She was assigned the role of having charisma, being more beginner friendly, asking questions, and showing off less chess knowledge, while the men had more expert type roles. Then one day, one of the men was busy for 20 minutes or something and temporarily left the broadcast. Without missing a beat, Shahade immediately switched to doing his expert role while he was gone. Then she switched back to her usual role when he returned. She was capable of doing the expert role the whole time, and was more multi-talented and better at role switching than either of the men.</p>\n<p>Years earlier, Shahade was sexually harassed by one of the men involved in the chess broadcasts. This came out after he started sexually harassing another woman, which Shahade took offense to, so she complained. The result has been that neither of them (Shahade or the man) has been on the broadcast team again. This happened a few years ago in the U.S.</p>",

When you say something is an “artificial X”, that means that the artificial thing is a type of X, or it is acting in place of X. So this seems to reduce a vagina to a “hole”. When people say things about women having 3 holes in their vulva area, that doesn’t seem offensive, because it is only talking about the external hole part. (It is talking about how many openings there are, and differentiating that the vagina and urethra are 2 separate openings, not the same opening.) But calling the entire vagina a hole, or reducing it to nothing more than a hole, seems to imply that is its entire essence. That feels offensive to me. Part of your implication seems to be that if you take away the reproductive aspect, a vagina is just a hole.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"anonymous45\" data-post=\"30\" data-topic=\"2108\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/a/a87d85/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> anonymous45:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, to follow the analogy, it doesn’t matter how good fake penises and vaginas/labias/etc get, if not all the roles of the original are fulfilled (including sexual reproduction), then what are they but glorified sex toys?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>This was already pointed out as offensive by <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/anonymous105\">@anonymous105</a>, but this one seems offensive to me too.

They’re not just for sex, so the fact bottom surgery only partially replaces the function of these organs means I consider them a worse simulation than an artificial heart which AFAIK performs all the important functions (besides longevity perhaps if we can call that a function). I think whether the artificial organ partially or fully replicates the natural organ’s function is important.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>I don’t actually know anything specific about this, but I think it’s incredibly unlikely that an artificial heart performs all the important functions of a heart. There are a lot of things we don’t fully understand with cell signalling, and the artificial heart isn’t going to be able to participate in cell signalling. There are a lot of different feedback loops and cascade effects in the body that an artificial heart is not going to be able to participate in properly.</p>\n<p>This is relevant to the trans stuff. One of the things I have noticed about anti-trans rhetoric is that anti-trans people tend to hold trans surgeries and medical procedures to a different standard than they hold other procedures to. They are worried about people regretting trans surgeries, but not worried about them regretting other kinds of surgeries. They are worried about complications and unintended effects and medicalizing yourself with trans procedures, but not worried about that with other procedures.</p>\n<p>So this seems related to that. You want to claim there is something fundamentally different and worse about trans surgeries compared to other surgeries, to the point that we need to use an entirely different type of language to talk about them than what is standard.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"anonymous45\" data-post=\"62\" data-topic=\"2108\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/a/a87d85/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> anonymous45:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think abortion should be available but not abused or used as a contraceptive (condoms are cheap, just use those as a starting point).

Note: any situation involving rape is a completely separate topic and deserves different policies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>This is problematic in a few different ways. One way is related to the stuff I brought up above about genital checks. How do you propose that we restrict abortion without accidentally restricting it from rape victims too? What kind of systems should be in place to make rape victims prove that they are actually victims? Those are rhetorical questions. I don’t think they have good answers.</p>",

See e.g. <a href=\"https://jessica.substack.com/p/the-week-in-abortion-ee9\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">The Week in Abortion - by Jessica Valenti</a> and also try reading through the titles of recent articles on that site.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>I am not familiar – that much is immediately obvious to me looking at the first article.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://jessica.substack.com/i/173447780/the-white-house-says-birth-control-is-abortion\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">On Friday</a>, <strong>the Trump administration told</strong> <em><strong>The New York Times</strong></em> <strong>that contraception like IUDs and the Pill aren’t birth control at all—but abortion.</strong> The stunning admission came in a statement about a $10 million stockpile of IUDs, oral contraceptives, and hormonal implants the administration plans to incinerate rather than distribute to women abroad:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“President Trump is committed to protecting the lives of unborn children all around the world. The administration will <strong>no longer supply abortifacient birth control</strong> under the guise of foreign aid.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I thought IUDs prevented fertilization and the pill prevents ovulation. It seems insane to class either as abortion. It also seems insane to burn those kind of resources instead of either letting them be distributed as planned or finding some other use for them.</p>\n<p>I thought Trump was much closer to the ‘safe, rare, and legal’ position (putting aside state based stuff in the US); I know many republicans are anti-abortion tho. Safe, rare, legal is close to my position for what it’s worth. I think abortion should be available but not abused or used as a contraceptive (condoms are cheap, just use those as a starting point). If abortion were a service provided by socialized healthcare, I’d support most something like one free one per year (and it costs something after that), but using that every year is problematic. Note: any situation involving rape is a completely separate topic and deserves different policies.</p>",

With anything like this, they’d also have to find me attractive so idk maybe 10-20% on top as a guess, so ~0.5-1.0% of the population.<br>\nI am already aware that this is highly selective and have done more detailed estimates in the past.<br>\nCuriously it’s easier to get worse proportions than this but somewhat hard to get into single digits without entering into designer-girlfriend/stalkerish territory.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"anonymous112\" data-post=\"58\" data-topic=\"2108\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/a/b9bd4f/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> anonymous112:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you wouldn’t leave your wife for gaining weight after having children, then you should reconsider being picky about weight now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Yeah I wouldn’t, or at least I don’t intend to and have a strong aversion to that kind of thing since it’s uncooperative and worse for the kids. I also have a strong aversion to some related things like infidelity. I have some related goals about being in the same relationship when I’m elderly.</p>\n<p>On a note related to feminism: I feel let down by my parents because they didn’t challenge me much on the topic of kids or discuss it much with me when I was younger (15-25). If I end up having kids, it’s one of the things I’ll encourage them to think about and plan in their adolescent/early-adult period, since leaving it too late eliminates a lot of options and the safest option is to assume your desire for children will increase with age. I think one of the reasons that my parents and their generation failed to pass on a lot of these kinds of values is related to 2nd wave feminism (and the sharp decline in fertility around the 70s). It’s curious because my mother was just past mid 20s when she had her first child, despite having tertiary education at that point. It’s hard to imagine many women today doing that, but maybe I’m biased. I think the apparent deprioritization of children in life planning among millennials and gen z is concerning.</p>\n<p>There are some related elements from later in BFGTF, too (like ch 7/8 from memory)</p>",
