Also from the conversation they brought up the book <em>Governed By Affect</em> by Michael Pettit. I found something potentially relevant there: a logic error by Pettit. Here’s the first paragraph I read (from early in chapter 5; I saw something familiar in the table of contents and skipped to it):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The famous Linda Problem, first introduced in 1983, exemplified Kahneman and Taversky’s approach to understanding the fallacies of human judgments when the mind largely runs on automatic. They presented participants with the following description of a fictional person: “Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in antinuclear demonstrations.” They then asked participants to rank a variety of statements about Linda in the order of their likelihood. Respondents tended to rank the conjunction of attributes “Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement” as more likely than either attribute appearing in isolation. <strong>The conjoined statement appeared to be more representative of her person as a whole, even though statistically speaking, she more likely possessed only one of the attributes.</strong>[4] People failed at reasoning by succumbing to quick, appeasing, intuitive shortcuts instead of slowing their thinking sufficiently to contemplate the problem to solve it correctly. [bold added]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here, Pettit is talking about laypeople being bad at logic.

Like the adversity is they had to go find some more evidence and their boss doubted them in the middle. Medical drama TV shows often follow the same structure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Depends a lot on the show. Sometimes police procedurals also include stuff like protagonists getting into gunfights, which would be adversity in real life but are often portrayed as mostly just thrilling and badass.</p>\n<p>But in general I mostly had long form stories such as novels and movies in mind. Serialized shows often don’t have the same adversity <em>every episode</em> but they might have the protagonists face some serious adversity periodically, e.g. season finales or dramatic 2-part episodes.</p>\n<p>Most episodes of House he is just snarky and the patient is the one facing adversity, but every so often he ends up in prison or has a traumatic drug induced hallucination or whatever. If you look at the totality of any given show’s run, most of them do have genuine non-trivial adversity pop up at least a couple times. But again I do agree it varies based on genre, and some genres are fairly low in adversity.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"Elliot\" data-post=\"20\" data-topic=\"2144\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/user_avatar/discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/elliot/48/14_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> Elliot:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Atlas Shrugged</em> and <em>The Fountainhead</em> are more in line with highly respected books for having more adversity, drama, ups and downs, etc. It’s different than a lot of plotlines you’d see with Superman, Star Trek, Law and Order, fanfiction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Yeah, I agree. I did intend to imply this with this line (bold added):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many protagonists in <strong>successful</strong> fiction experience very real, serious setbacks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You mentioned Star Trek… while many individual episodes may be fairly low stakes, over the course of their runs (mostly thinking of the ones I know well, from the 90s; TNG, DS9, VOY) there is a lot of really serious adversity! Characters are tortured, imprisoned, experimented on, stranded in hostile environments for extended periods, injured in critical condition, die, lose loved ones, face major moral dilemmas that challenge their beliefs, etc.</p>\n<p>I have become a much bigger fan of Star Trek after rewatching it recently, I think overall it does this sort of thing better than many other examples of serialized fiction (Law and Order, etc.) where I agree with you more.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"Elliot\" data-post=\"20\" data-topic=\"2144\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/user_avatar/discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/elliot/48/14_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> Elliot:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you don’t think AS and FH show success as hard, then do any stories (particularly about realistic scenarios, not zombie apocalypses)?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>No, I do think FH shows success as hard within the story. I was just saying that because it has a happy ending for the protagonist I think a lot of people can come away from it feeling good. And that can extend into feeling empowered, like they can do it too, like maybe it’s not <em>that</em> hard, etc.</p>\n<p>Some of these reactions are probably good, but my guess is that they can also lead to overconfidence. This feels like a classic difficult problem between confidence and overconfidence. You don’t want people to feel demoralized and hopeless, but it’s also not good if they get arrogant and sloppy.</p>\n<p>I don’t really have a solution to that problem. To the extent I don’t think a solution to it is present in Rand’s fiction, I don’t think that’s her fault. It’s not really the problem she was trying to solve anyway.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"Elliot\" data-post=\"20\" data-topic=\"2144\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/user_avatar/discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/elliot/48/14_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> Elliot:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And <em>We the Living</em> doesn’t have a good ending despite having a deserving hero.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Yeah I have not read that but I am aware of it and was pretty sure that it had a bleak ending. I only mentioned FH because that’s the only one I remembered well and was pretty confident about.</p>\n<p>I also think storytelling often follows guidelines about when it is or isn’t a good idea to have a bleak unhappy ending. Some genres and types of stories can more reliably get away with bleak endings.</p>\n<p>Dystopian stories are a good example.

      "raw": "[quote=\"Elliot, post:20, topic:2144\"]\nIf you watch TV shows, e.g. police procedurals, things tend to wrap up positively in under an hour, often with minimal adversity. Like the adversity is they had to go find some more evidence and their boss doubted them in the middle. Medical drama TV shows often follow the same structure.\n\n[/quote]\n\nDepends a lot on the show. Sometimes police procedurals also include stuff like protagonists getting into gunfights, which would be adversity in real life but are often portrayed as mostly just thrilling and badass.\n\nBut in general I mostly had long form stories such as novels and movies in mind. Serialized shows often don’t have the same adversity *every episode* but they might have the protagonists face some serious adversity periodically, e.g. season finales or dramatic 2-part episodes.\n\nMost episodes of House he is just snarky and the patient is the one facing adversity, but every so often he ends up in prison or has a traumatic drug induced hallucination or whatever. If you look at the totality of any given show’s run, most of them do have genuine non-trivial adversity pop up at least a couple times. But again I do agree it varies based on genre, and some genres are fairly low in adversity.\n\n[quote=\"Elliot, post:20, topic:2144\"]\n*Atlas Shrugged* and *The Fountainhead* are more in line with highly respected books for having more adversity, drama, ups and downs, etc. It’s different than a lot of plotlines you’d see with Superman, Star Trek, Law and Order, fanfiction.\n\n[/quote]\n\nYeah, I agree. I did intend to imply this with this line (bold added):\n\n> Many protagonists in **successful** fiction experience very real, serious setbacks.\n\nYou mentioned Star Trek… while many individual episodes may be fairly low stakes, over the course of their runs (mostly thinking of the ones I know well, from the 90s; TNG, DS9, VOY) there is a lot of really serious adversity! Characters are tortured, imprisoned, experimented on, stranded in hostile environments for extended periods, injured in critical condition, die, lose loved ones, face major moral dilemmas that challenge their beliefs, etc.\n\nI have become a much bigger fan of Star Trek after rewatching it recently, I think overall it does this sort of thing better than many other examples of serialized fiction (Law and Order, etc.) where I agree with you more. \n\n[quote=\"Elliot, post:20, topic:2144\"]\nIf you don’t think AS and FH show success as hard, then do any stories (particularly about realistic scenarios, not zombie apocalypses)?\n\n[/quote]\n\nNo, I do think FH shows success as hard within the story. I was just saying that because it has a happy ending for the protagonist I think a lot of people can come away from it feeling good. And that can extend into feeling empowered, like they can do it too, like maybe it’s not *that* hard, etc.\n\nSome of these reactions are probably good, but my guess is that they can also lead to overconfidence. This feels like a classic difficult problem between confidence and overconfidence. You don’t want people to feel demoralized and hopeless, but it’s also not good if they get arrogant and sloppy.\n\nI don’t really have a solution to that problem. To the extent I don’t think a solution to it is present in Rand’s fiction, I don’t think that’s her fault. It’s not really the problem she was trying to solve anyway.\n\n[quote=\"Elliot, post:20, topic:2144\"]\nAnd *We the Living* doesn’t have a good ending despite having a deserving hero.\n\n[/quote]\n\nYeah I have not read that but I am aware of it and was pretty sure that it had a bleak ending. I only mentioned FH because that’s the only one I remembered well and was pretty confident about.\n\nI also think storytelling often follows guidelines about when it is or isn’t a good idea to have a bleak unhappy ending. Some genres and types of stories can more reliably get away with bleak endings.\n\nDystopian stories are a good example. AS & FH have elements of dystopianism in them but I think they are more like big dramas. I haven’t read *We the Living* but my  understanding is that it’s more of a true dystopian story. So that would track. \n\nAlso, I have a theory that short stories can get away with bleak endings more reliably than long form stories. Not to say long form stories don’t have bleak endings sometimes. But I think it’s much more common in short stories. I have noticed this a lot in Science Fiction. Short speculative Sci-Fi is often bleak, dystopian, horrific, or otherwise has sad/bad endings. Long form Sci-Fi, even if it is overall bleak, will usually have some element of hope in the ending.\n\nMy guess for why this is: Bleak endings can leave readers feeling bad.

It can create a sense of moral clarity.\n\nIt’d be like the difference between reading about a character who wastes time on Facebook instead of studying for an impending exam… versus actually being a person IRL who spends time on Facebook instead of studying.\n\nI think when you read about someone else doing it, it can feel more obvious when they’re making a mistake. Besides, authors often write in a slanted/stylized sort of way that makes it clearer what the right and wrong decisions are.\n\n(Also, viewing one’s own actions through someone else’s perspective can have the same effect. E.g., having a boss looking over one’s shoulder can make one more acutely aware of when one is doing something subpar.)\n\n[quote=\"Elliot, post:22, topic:2144\"]\nDo you feel that way with other fiction? Detective stuff? Superhero stuff? Outer space stuff? Doctors saving patients?\n\n[/quote]\n\nI don’t think so. Perhaps because being a detective, astronaut, or doctor requires skills that I don’t have (and it’s intuitively obvious to me that I don’t have those skills).\n\nI don’t think I could be as good of a detective as Hercule Poirot or Sherlock Holmes. (At least not without decades of practice. And even then, I’d probably still fail to reach their skill level.)\n\nMaybe people view moral knowledge/skill as easier and more accessible than technical skill. Perhaps people feel that it’s easier to become a hero than a brain surgeon.",

A forum account can only be linked once, so make sure you save the generated username and pw in your password manager.</p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c4211398808a5b4768470bb5f33239c38a10f03a.png\" data-download-href=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/uploads/default/c4211398808a5b4768470bb5f33239c38a10f03a\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c4211398808a5b4768470bb5f33239c38a10f03a.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"rZ2rVggOzeSKowGYwFP7MWDvfWW\" width=\"690\" height=\"207\" data-dominant-color=\"141416\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">image</span><span class=\"informations\">719×216 13.7 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>If you find that you can do anything that seems like it should be admin only, please report it as a bug (eg deleting an archived item, forcing a re-archive, you can access <a href=\"https://cf-archiver.xk.io/admin/user/1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://cf-archiver.xk.io/admin/user/1</a>, etc).</p>\n<p>Please note: this has not been tested very much.

I think people in general struggle to match values they talk about. This kind of reminds of me something related to Rand. I think Peikoff mentioned how when Atlas Shrugged was first published. He and others (and maybe Rand?) thought the world would get better fast because of the convincingness of Atlas Shrugged. Instead people read it, some (maybe a lot, idk) liked it, said they agreed with it, and changed pmuch nothing on their lives. \n\nI wonder if it has something to do with something else I’ve heard of before (I think from Rand?): the church mentality (or smth like that). People care about their values only at like important times. Not in their general lives. You go to church and you’ll do charity and stuff. The rest of the week you’re your average self. \n\n[quote=\"Apricus, post:4, topic:2144\"]\nIt might also be that movies and media in general make it seem easier to be nice than it actually is in real life. Perhaps it idealizes or romanticizes the actual execution of those values.\n\n[/quote]\n\n\\~yeah. I think media makes things feel easier than they are. reading something like Atlas Shrugged or The Fountainhead makes having integrity and being rational easy. I don’t think Rand wrote it in a way that said their easy. But something about reading about it makes it feel easy.",

I’m unsure of what possibilities I was considering. It can’t be an infinitive. it would be tell and to tell doesn’t work. its not a gerund. I don’t think its a participle.

I’ll clarify: Plagiarism is taking credit for ideas or knowledge that you got from a source rather than creating yourself. Or, as I put it in 2020 when criticizing Hackethal’s book: Plagiarism is taking credit for ideas or writing that isn’t yours. The New Oxford American Dictionary defines plagiarism as: the practice of taking someone else’s work or ideas and passing them off as one’s own The Macmillan English Dictionary defines plagiarism as: the process of taking another person’s work, ideas, or words, and using them as if they were your own. The Oxford English Dictionary defines plagiarize as: to take and use as one’s own the thoughts, writings, or inventions of another. These all say pretty much the same thing. I think it’s important to understand that any type of knowledge can be plagiarized, even if it’s not in words or doesn’t resemble a scientific theory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>To me, that definition sounds pretty standard, and between this post and your earlier essays, you’ve given enough examples that I get what you mean. It’s not some mysterious or ultra-specific definition. I can see how applying it can get messy in edge cases, but that’s exactly the kind of thing people should debate and criticise directly. And from what I can tell, Dennis didn’t really do that. He didn’t clearly argue against your definition, and he didn’t seem to defend the specific passages in his book by laying out where the ideas came from.</p>\n<p>On concern <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2</span>, your breakdown of his examples and quoting made me realize I should’ve been more skeptical. I think I took a lot of what he said close to face value (briefly reading some of his examples he linked or quoted) and there wasn’t really a good reason for me to do that without checking more thoroughly.</p>\n<p>Also, I appreciate the part where you explained what matters most to you. With misquotes, you care most about whether the meaning is represented accurately, not whether someone changed a tab to spaces. With plagiarism, you care most about whether someone is misleading people about credit, not the exact formatting or where a citation appears. That clears up something I was worried about. I was concerned you might be being overly strict or pedantic, but I don’t think that anymore.</p>",

I wasn’t sure what your definition of plagiarism actually was. It didn’t feel clearly stated to me.\n\n2. Whatever standard you were using, I wasn’t sure you were applying it consistently, including to your own writing.\n\nOn concern #1 you do clarify your definition here:\n\n[quote=\"Elliot, post:1, topic:2145\"]\nHackethal presents inaccurate information about what I think plagiarism is and he doesn’t specify what he thinks it is. I’ll clarify: Plagiarism is taking credit for ideas or knowledge that you got from a source rather than creating yourself. Or, as I put it in 2020 when criticizing Hackethal’s book: Plagiarism is taking credit for ideas or writing that isn’t yours. The New Oxford American Dictionary defines plagiarism as: the practice of taking someone else’s work or ideas and passing them off as one’s own The Macmillan English Dictionary defines plagiarism as: the process of taking another person’s work, ideas, or words, and using them as if they were your own. The Oxford English Dictionary defines plagiarize as: to take and use as one’s own the thoughts, writings, or inventions of another. These all say pretty much the same thing. I think it’s important to understand that any type of knowledge can be plagiarized, even if it’s not in words or doesn’t resemble a scientific theory.\n\n[/quote]\n\nTo me, that definition sounds pretty standard, and between this post and your earlier essays, you’ve given enough examples that I get what you mean. It’s not some mysterious or ultra-specific definition. I can see how applying it can get messy in edge cases, but that’s exactly the kind of thing people should debate and criticise directly. And from what I can tell, Dennis didn’t really do that. He didn’t clearly argue against your definition, and he didn’t seem to defend the specific passages in his book by laying out where the ideas came from.\n\nOn concern #2, your breakdown of his examples and quoting made me realize I should’ve been more skeptical. I think I took a lot of what he said close to face value (briefly reading some of his examples he linked or quoted) and there wasn’t really a good reason for me to do that without checking more thoroughly.\n\nAlso, I appreciate the part where you explained what matters most to you. With misquotes, you care most about whether the meaning is represented accurately, not whether someone changed a tab to spaces. With plagiarism, you care most about whether someone is misleading people about credit, not the exact formatting or where a citation appears. That clears up something I was worried about. I was concerned you might be being overly strict or pedantic, but I don’t think that anymore.",

This can teach their children the attitude to look for logical patterns and so they get practice doing it. This eventually leads to the child scoring better on IQ tests. So the parents have been implicitly teaching their child to score better on IQ tests, explaining some of the correlation between parents and child IQ.",
