Also, realistic historical dramas (whether fiction or not) are another genre that often have very bleak endings regardless of the story’s length. Depending on what era of history, at least. I think this makes sense… History can be very bleak, and people often know the broad strokes of the bleak historical period before they start the story. Both of those facts contribute to it being a more accepted type of ending.</p>",

Like the adversity is they had to go find some more evidence and their boss doubted them in the middle. Medical drama TV shows often follow the same structure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Depends a lot on the show. Sometimes police procedurals also include stuff like protagonists getting into gunfights, which would be adversity in real life but are often portrayed as mostly just thrilling and badass.</p>\n<p>But in general I mostly had long form stories such as novels and movies in mind. Serialized shows often don’t have the same adversity <em>every episode</em> but they might have the protagonists face some serious adversity periodically, e.g. season finales or dramatic 2-part episodes.</p>\n<p>Most episodes of House he is just snarky and the patient is the one facing adversity, but every so often he ends up in prison or has a traumatic drug induced hallucination or whatever. If you look at the totality of any given show’s run, most of them do have genuine non-trivial adversity pop up at least a couple times. But again I do agree it varies based on genre, and some genres are fairly low in adversity.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"Elliot\" data-post=\"20\" data-topic=\"2144\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/user_avatar/discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/elliot/48/14_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> Elliot:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Atlas Shrugged</em> and <em>The Fountainhead</em> are more in line with highly respected books for having more adversity, drama, ups and downs, etc. It’s different than a lot of plotlines you’d see with Superman, Star Trek, Law and Order, fanfiction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Yeah, I agree. I did intend to imply this with this line (bold added):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many protagonists in <strong>successful</strong> fiction experience very real, serious setbacks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You mentioned Star Trek… while many individual episodes may be fairly low stakes, over the course of their runs (mostly thinking of the ones I know well, from the 90s; TNG, DS9, VOY) there is a lot of really serious adversity! Characters are tortured, imprisoned, experimented on, stranded in hostile environments for extended periods, injured in critical condition, die, lose loved ones, face major moral dilemmas that challenge their beliefs, etc.</p>\n<p>I have become a much bigger fan of Star Trek after rewatching it recently, I think overall it does this sort of thing better than many other examples of serialized fiction (Law and Order, etc.) where I agree with you more.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"Elliot\" data-post=\"20\" data-topic=\"2144\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/user_avatar/discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/elliot/48/14_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> Elliot:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you don’t think AS and FH show success as hard, then do any stories (particularly about realistic scenarios, not zombie apocalypses)?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>No, I do think FH shows success as hard within the story. I was just saying that because it has a happy ending for the protagonist I think a lot of people can come away from it feeling good. And that can extend into feeling empowered, like they can do it too, like maybe it’s not <em>that</em> hard, etc.</p>\n<p>Some of these reactions are probably good, but my guess is that they can also lead to overconfidence. This feels like a classic difficult problem between confidence and overconfidence. You don’t want people to feel demoralized and hopeless, but it’s also not good if they get arrogant and sloppy.</p>\n<p>I don’t really have a solution to that problem. To the extent I don’t think a solution to it is present in Rand’s fiction, I don’t think that’s her fault. It’s not really the problem she was trying to solve anyway.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"Elliot\" data-post=\"20\" data-topic=\"2144\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/user_avatar/discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/elliot/48/14_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> Elliot:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And <em>We the Living</em> doesn’t have a good ending despite having a deserving hero.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Yeah I have not read that but I am aware of it and was pretty sure that it had a bleak ending. I only mentioned FH because that’s the only one I remembered well and was pretty confident about.</p>\n<p>I also think storytelling often follows guidelines about when it is or isn’t a good idea to have a bleak unhappy ending. Some genres and types of stories can more reliably get away with bleak endings.</p>\n<p>Dystopian stories are a good example. AS &amp; FH have elements of dystopianism in them but I think they are more like big dramas. I haven’t read <em>We the Living</em> but my  understanding is that it’s more of a true dystopian story. So that would track.</p>\n<p>Also, I have a theory that short stories can get away with bleak endings more reliably than long form stories. Not to say long form stories don’t have bleak endings sometimes. But I think it’s much more common in short stories. I have noticed this a lot in Science Fiction. Short speculative Sci-Fi is often bleak, dystopian, horrific, or otherwise has sad/bad endings. Long form Sci-Fi, even if it is overall bleak, will usually have some element of hope in the ending.</p>\n<p>My guess for why this is: Bleak endings can leave readers feeling bad. But the longer time you’ve spent with the protagonists, the more emotionally invested you are, the worse it can end up feeling. For shorter stories, the bleak ending can be sad but the thought-provoking and challenging elements can be interesting enough to be the primary thing the reader thinks about. For long stories, it can be harder to appreciate that stuff if the ending of the story is too bleak and all of the characters the reader grew attached to end the story in a horrible place.</p>",

I wasn’t talking about how the setbacks the characters face per se. Its more so something about just reading it makes it feel easier to achieve than it actually is.

No, but something about reading those actions makes it feel like something I can do. Its like by reading I felt like I did it.</p>",

I think at least Fountainhead is like this — Roark ends the book in a triumphant way, his life is going well, he is doing architecture and he got the girl.</p>\n<p>That is meaningfully different from the setbacks being <strong>superficial</strong>. Many protagonists in successful fiction experience very real, serious setbacks. They get badly injured, or lose their job, or have their reputation smeared, or have close friends die, or get their heart broken, etc. But in most fiction, the protagonist overcomes the setbacks and ends the story in a triumphant way.</p>\n<p>My guess would be the exceptions in either direction — the story ending sadly with the setbacks having broken the protagonist, or the story being an easy experience where most stuff just works out with minimal problems for the protagonist — aren’t uncommon but might be a relative minority. Though it varies some across genres, too.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"Apricus\" data-post=\"4\" data-topic=\"2144\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/user_avatar/discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/apricus/48/855_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> Apricus:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It might also be that movies and media in general make it seem easier to be nice than it actually is in real life.

Not just when the setbacks are superficial/trivial.</p>\n<p>Because by the end of the story things worked out okay. People often are biased to most remember their feeling at the end of a story rather than how they felt throughout it (e.g. when the hero was at their lowest). So if things worked out in the end, I wouldn’t be surprised if many people come away from that feeling like it wasn’t all that bad and they, too, could have done what the protagonist did.</p>",

I think people in general struggle to match values they talk about. This kind of reminds of me something related to Rand. I think Peikoff mentioned how when Atlas Shrugged was first published. He and others (and maybe Rand?) thought the world would get better fast because of the convincingness of Atlas Shrugged. Instead people read it, some (maybe a lot, idk) liked it, said they agreed with it, and changed pmuch nothing on their lives.</p>\n<p>I wonder if it has something to do with something else I’ve heard of before (I think from Rand?): the church mentality (or smth like that). People care about their values only at like important times. Not in their general lives. You go to church and you’ll do charity and stuff. The rest of the week you’re your average self.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"Apricus\" data-post=\"4\" data-topic=\"2144\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/user_avatar/discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/apricus/48/855_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> Apricus:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It might also be that movies and media in general make it seem easier to be nice than it actually is in real life.

I think media makes things feel easier than they are. reading something like Atlas Shrugged or The Fountainhead makes having integrity and being rational easy. I don’t think Rand wrote it in a way that said their easy. But something about reading about it makes it feel easy.</p>",

Ok, what about the people who are good enough at singing high notes, but need to work on having a more consistent tone or sing low notes or soemthing(idk a lot about music).

Just cuz they have limited time and attention, it doesn’t mean they have to be mean to anyone.</p>\n<p>Because people are mean anyways, that’s the difficulty you were talking about in the next sentence?

Or that people are intolerant of others when they don’t have to? Or is the difficulty something that is hard to understand? Like, those that view the theme as saying to be nice to everyone, etc. are being unrealistic. You can’t be nice to everyone. The difficulty is that they are being unrealistic.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group quote-modified\" data-username=\"Elliot\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"2144\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/user_avatar/discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/elliot/48/14_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> Elliot:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think it’s even connected with violence because being dismissive of people leads to unfamiliarity not respect, which I think does serve to help enable violence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>The difficulty is connected with violence?</p>",
