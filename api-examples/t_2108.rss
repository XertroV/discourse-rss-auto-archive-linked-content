<p>That’s not a sanity check. And IPV by a man against a lesbian is not an inconsistency.</p>
<p>Once again, I think you are confused about the goal of studies like this.</p>
<p>Here is an article about disparities of pregnancy risk in teens across different sexual orientations:</p>

  <p>Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which sexual identity and/or sexual behaviors were associated with pregnancy risk factors (condom use, alcohol or other drug use before sex, and World Health Organization [WHO] Tier 1...</p>

<p>One thing you’ll note is lots of consideration of pregnancy risks due to lack of condoms used by self-identified lesbians. Because sexual minority teens report less condom use than sexual majority teens. And the study isn’t focused on making political points, it is focused on identifying risk groups in order to help them.</p>
<p>And then there is an issue where on some studies have a combined sexual minority group that includes bisexual girls and lesbians together.</p>
<p>But also, from that analysis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some inconsistent findings have also emerged in the literature on sexual minority girls’ pregnancy risk. Findings from studies using New York City YRBS<sup><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6797072/#B6" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">6</a></sup> and other data,<sup><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6797072/#B15" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">15</a></sup> in which lesbian and bisexual girls have been combined, suggest that both groups are more likely than their heterosexual counterparts to report a teen pregnancy. However, studies that separate lesbian and bisexual girls in analyses have found that bisexual-identified or bisexual-behaving girls are more likely than heterosexual girls to report a pregnancy<sup><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6797072/#B1" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">1</a>,<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6797072/#B3" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">3</a>,<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6797072/#B9" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">9</a></sup> or a pregnancy termination,<sup><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6797072/#B16" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">16</a></sup> whereas for lesbian-identified girls, there is either no difference<sup><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6797072/#B1" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">1</a>,<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6797072/#B9" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">9</a>,<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6797072/#B16" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">16</a></sup> or lower risk<sup><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6797072/#B3" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">3</a></sup> of teen pregnancy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It turns out lesbian girls don’t have higher risk of teen pregnancy than heterosexual girls. Though in some studies, they have <strong>comparable</strong> risks.</p>
<p>Your assumption that “self-identified lesbian in a survey” equals “this respondent’s relationships are exclusively with other women” is not accurate.</p>
<p>In those studies, bisexual girls have higher risk of teen pregnancy than heterosexual ones. This makes sense because bisexual teenagers report higher rates of alcohol use, less rates of condom use, etc. Lesbian teenagers also have higher rates of alcohol use, less condom use, etc. So presumably the reason their pregnancy rates are lower than bisexuals (but not necessarily lower than heterosexuals) is due to having fewer relationships with men.</p>
<p>The risky behaviors above make sense because those are also correlated with teenagers who have a history of abuse, and LGBT people also have higher likelihood of having experienced childhood abuse:</p>

<p>Bisexual women also have the highest rates of IPV based on the data we were discussing earlier. Of course, most bisexual women are in relationships with men:</p>

<p>84% of bisexuals are in relationships with the opposite gender, versus gay men (2%) or lesbians (1%).</p>
<p>Note that this 1% for lesbians doesn’t preclude any of my earlier points because this is specifically polling people who <strong>currently identify as lesbians</strong> and who their <strong>current long term partner is</strong> — which is not the case for the IPV surveys, which are based on any instances of IPV experienced with a given timeframe.</p>

<p>Yeah it is even more pronounced in the bi category, as I just went over. But most lesbians have had relationships with men in the past.</p>

<p>And it’s a common discussion topic:</p>

<p>So for a survey that is specifically overrepresenting younger people, this all makes sense to me. I don’t think I’m grasping at straws at all, I think I am presenting a coherent, logical possible explanation of the facts.</p>
<p>LGBT people have higher rates of abusive childhood, and that comes with various negative predictions about risky behaviors. Alcohol usage, low condom usage, and subsequent abusive relationships all go along with that. But there’s no reason to assume those abusive relationships are predominantly with women, even for respondents that identify as lesbians. The abusive relationships could easily have been with men.</p>
<p>There’s also some good discussion on this general topic here, which I stumbled across when looking up some of those studies above.</p>

<p>Okay. Before, you seemed to have a strong desire to avoid acknowledging that LGB relationships even could have higher levels of IPV.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t have a problem acknowledging it as a possibility, but I don’t think it is the most logical explanation. I think that is a conclusion that gets draw in order to try to score political points about feminism or LGBT people, not a conclusion based in reality.</p>
<p>Also, all of this is setting aside other possible factors for IPV rates (such as likelihood of reporting) that I mentioned a few months ago but haven’t brought up again in this discussion. I noticed that reddit thread I just linked does have a few comments that bring that up though.</p>

<p>As I said before…</p>

<p>Although… note that a girl who thought she was straight, tried to break up with her boyfriend because she realized she was a lesbian, was assaulted by the boyfriend when she broke up with him, then was kicked out of her home for being gay and entered into a non-abusive lesbian relationship would present as <strong>the exact same person</strong> in these studies. e.g. “Lesbian who experienced IPV within the last 12 months.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given the largest age categories surveyed are 18-19 and 20-24, it’s not implausible at all for them to have experienced more than one relationship in the past 12 months. And given that this is true repeatedly across multiple years of surveys, the surveys are consistently capturing <strong>different people</strong>, since the same person can’t be in the same age category for more than a few years in a row. If the surveys were following the same people we would expect the largest age categories to get older over time, but they don’t.</p>

</aside>
<p>One addendum… I’m not saying the data is <strong>incompatible</strong> with abusive lesbians. I’m just saying it does not tell us anything in particular about abusive lesbians.</p>
<p>So if by “it definitely doesn’t” you mean “it definitely does not say rates of abuse are higher in lesbian relationships” I agree, that is what I was saying.</p>
<p>But if by “it definitely doesn’t” you mean “it definitely says rates of abuse are <strong>not</strong> higher in lesbian relationships” then that’s not what I was saying, no.</p>

<p>If you’re referring to the screenshot you just posted of the reddit thread, then disregard what I am about to write. I did not have access to the full post anymore when I wrote that comment. I’ll review the rest of the thread for other claims later. But for now I’m assuming this is the screenshot in question since it was what I was replying to above.</p>
<p>Looking at this screenshot, I stand by what I said. I also downloaded one of the spreadsheets and scrolled through it and did not see anything that contradicts what I said. I’ll try to explain it more clearly.</p>
<p>The lefthand columns are for the characteristics of the respondents. The <strong>individual respondents.</strong> What age are they, what nationality, what marital status, what sexual orientation, etc.</p>
<p>None of these fields are for characteristics of <strong>the relationships.</strong> Quoting just a snippet of your sentence to focus in:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the rate for any kind of abuse from one partner on the other for gay/lesbian relationships where the victim is a woman is 9.8 somethings</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s the inaccurate assumption you’re making. What it actually says is the rate for any kind of abuse from one partner on the other for women who identify as lesbians is 9.8 somethings.</p>
<p>You are assuming this implies a female perpetrator. But it doesn’t. Someone identifying as a lesbian on the survey does not imply that their previous abuse was in a lesbian relationship. It doesn’t tell us anything about their previous abusive relationship one way or the other.</p>
<p>As I said before…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although… note that a girl who thought she was straight, tried to break up with her boyfriend because she realized she was a lesbian, was assaulted by the boyfriend when she broke up with him, then was kicked out of her home for being gay and entered into a non-abusive lesbian relationship would present as <strong>the exact same person</strong> in these studies. e.g. “Lesbian who experienced IPV within the last 12 months.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given the largest age categories surveyed are 18-19 and 20-24, it’s not implausible at all for them to have experienced more than one relationship in the past 12 months. And given that this is true repeatedly across multiple years of surveys, the surveys are consistently capturing <strong>different people</strong>, since the same person can’t be in the same age category for more than a few years in a row. If the surveys were following the same people we would expect the largest age categories to get older over time, but they don’t.</p>
<p>Does that make sense now?</p>
<p>As a thought experiment to help crystallize my point: imagine a regressive society where 100% of women who come out as gay are assaulted by state appointed agents as a punitive type of conversion therapy. In that society, 100% of lesbians would report having experienced abuse in their past. And the numbers on a 12 month rolling period would still be huge, especially for lower age brackets where people are more likely to have come out. Even if there were 0 abusive lesbians in such a society, a survey like this would show <strong>massively</strong> larger numbers for abuse reported by lesbian respondents.</p>
<p>Hopefully that helps clarify my point. This is why I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s worth emphasizing that this data <strong>doesn’t</strong> say that lesbians are more likely to commit IPV, or that lesbian relationships have higher rates of IPV. It has never said that, previously or now.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah, I noticed this too. (Edit: maybe this is because there’s no conviction. You don’t need a conviction to report the victim, but it might be problematic if recording perpetrators.)</p>
<p>That said, if intimate partner violence is marked as coming from a gay/lesbian relationship, I don’t see how this isn’t a close approximation for the perpetrator.</p>

<p>I still had a tab open luckily. reddit thread:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">

<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2c32b30be212a258625aeb8bcaced3eb2d02c41e.jpeg" data-download-href="https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/uploads/default/2c32b30be212a258625aeb8bcaced3eb2d02c41e" title="image"><img src="https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2c32b30be212a258625aeb8bcaced3eb2d02c41e.jpeg" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="6iZDa75lChrVosrh64UhVVszKl8" width="640" height="443"></a></div><p></p>
<p>There has been a lot of harmful rhetoric in the manosphere, especially regarding data on domestic violence among lesbians. I’ve seen people use this to justify men abusing women. So, I did some study on this topic and what I found was lesbians do not have the highest rate of domestic violence. In fact, they have the lowest. Lesbians are also the only group of women who are more likely to be murdered by a male stranger than by their own partner. Here is some of the research I found:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lesbians are the safest demographic when it comes to domestic violence, according to the 2024 data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW). “Lesbians are actually less likely to experience domestic abuse compared to straight women (3.4% of lesbians compared to 6.3%). Gay men are more likely to experience domestic abuse compared to straight men (7.6% of gay men compared to 2.8% of straight men).” Source: <a href="https://diva-magazine.com/2024/11/28/new-data-shows-bi-women-and-trans-people-are-more-likely-to-experience-domestic-abuse/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">New data shows bi+ women and trans people are more likely to experience domestic abuse&nbsp; -</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Edit:- Let me clear this up: these numbers do not only include violence lesbian women face from their female partners. They also include violence from male family members and male ex-partners. According to the 2023 and 2025 studies, lesbian women did report higher domestic violence than heterosexual women, but their rates were still lower than those of gay men and bisexual people. I mentioned these studies to show how widely the data can vary by year and sample size.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>For the USA, an age-adjusted study found that: “IPV rates for same-sex male and same-sex female households would be 11.8% and 27.3% lower if they had same age population.”</li>
</ol>
<p>To put it simply, this states that violence is most common among younger people. The only reason some data show higher rates for queer women is because most queer-identifying women are younger.

<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Most violence lesbian women face comes from hate crimes or abuse by male family members, not from their own partners. Additionally, the vast majority of lesbians’ murderers are men, Who account for nearly all perpetrators of anti-lesbian hate crimes. Source: <a href="https://www.scielo.br/j/csc/a/MGMGSTN9W6vjsJQYPxf65HM/?format=pdf&amp;lang=en" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Establishing a secure connection ...</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only 0.05% of intimate partner femicide perpetrators are female, while men account for 99.95%. Even when adjusting for population size, male perpetrators commit intimate partner femicides at a rate roughly 28 times higher than female (lesbian) perpetrators. So yes — lesbian intimate partner femicides are extremely rare compared to male-perpetrated ones, both in raw numbers and per capita. Source: <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10778012042650165" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10778012042650165</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reporting &amp; police data</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Most police reports show that lesbians are much less likely to report domestic abuse than other groups. For example: A study analyzing 176,488 police-reported IPV incidents from the U.S. National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) found that:</p>
<p>• 1,077 incidents involved same-sex couples Within those same-sex cases:</p>
<p>• ~60% male–male</p>
<p>• ~40% female–female</p>
<p>Additionally, the violence lesbians do report tends to have lower severity rates.</p>
<p>★Where does the idea that lesbians have the highest DV rates come from? It comes from a survey-based CDC study from 2010. Source: <a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/12362" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/12362</a></p>
<p>–According to the study, the lifetime prevalence of IPV (rape, physical violence, and/or stalking) is:</p>
<p>Lesbian women: 43.8%</p>
<p>Bisexual women: 61.1%</p>
<p>Heterosexual women: 35.0%</p>
<p>Right away, we see that bisexual women—not lesbians—have the highest IPV rates. Since bisexual women date both genders, the next step is to look at who the perpetrators are…</p>
<p>According to this study -</p>
<p>–Bisexual women:</p>
<p>61.1% total IPV × 89.5% male-only perpetrators</p>
<p>≈ 54.7% abused by men only</p>
<p>Heterosexual women:</p>
<p>35% total IPV × 98.7% male-only perpetrators</p>
<p>≈ 34.5% abused by men only</p>
<p>Lesbian women: 43.8% total IPV × 67.4% female-only perpetrators</p>
<p>≈ 29.5% abused by women only</p>
<p>So no — IPV from female partners is actually lowest for lesbian women compared to the rates at which bisexual and heterosexual women are abused by male partners.</p>
<p>–If bisexual women mostly report abuse from men or from heterosexual relationships, why do heterosexual women report lower IPV rates? The answer is age. An Age-adjusted population studies show that younger people report the highest rates of intimate partner violence. Since they are more likely to recognize abuse and name it. Queer populations skew younger overall. So bisexual and lesbian women are overrepresented in younger age groups, which naturally leads to higher reporting rates. If heterosexual women were examined within the same age ranges as bisexual or lesbian women, their reported IPV rates would be similar or higher than bisexual women. Source: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37705427/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Elucidating Intimate Partner Violence Rate Disparities Between Same- and Opposite-Sex Couples: A Demographic Approach - PubMed</a></p>
<p>Another way we can tell that heterosexual women are likely underreporting is by looking at lifetime prevalence data for sexual violence, including rape and sexual violence other than rape. Lifetime prevalence of rape by any perpetrator:</p>
<p>Lesbian women: 13.1%</p>
<p>Bisexual women: 46.1%</p>
<p>Heterosexual women: 17.4%</p>
<p>For perpetrators, the data states: “Most bisexual and heterosexual women (98.3% and 99.1%, respectively) who experienced rape in their lifetime reported having only male perpetrators. The number of lesbian victims was too low to calculate.”</p>
<p>Lifetime prevalence of sexual violence other than rape:</p>
<p>Lesbian women: 46.4%</p>
<p>Bisexual women: 74.9%</p>
<p>Heterosexual women: 43.3%</p>
<p>The report also says: “The majority of lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual women (85.2%, 87.5%, and 94.7%, respectively) who experienced sexual violence other than rape in their lifetime reported having only male perpetrators.”</p>
<p>It does not make sense that men would be disproportionately targeting sexual minority women. The more plausible explanation is that heterosexual women are underreporting.</p>
<p>–Many point to the CDC 2010 data claiming gay men report the lowest rates (26%) of intimate partner violence (IPV) , implying women are the main problem. But the reality is more complex. Not all data show gay men with the lowest IPV rates; some studies I mentioned previously indicate higher rates of domestic violence for gay men. But here are a few reasons why some studies, like CDC 2010, might show lower IPV rates for gay men:</p>
<p>1.Lower partnership rates: Gay men are less likely to be in partnered relationships than lesbians. For example, the Williams Institute found about 51% of lesbians are partnered, compared to only 35% of gay men. Since IPV involves partners, fewer partnerships mean fewer reported IPV cases.</p>
<p>2.Underreporting: Gay men tend to underreport IPV. The CDC shows gay men report 26% IPV prevalence but are 1.7 times more likely to need medical care and 16 times more likely to suffer injury than other groups.

<p>3.Homicide data: Intimate partner homicide data tells a different story. The Australian Institute of Criminology found that 88% of same-sex IPH victims were male Source:- <a href="https://www.aic.gov.au/publications/tandi/tandi469" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.aic.gov.au/publications/tandi/tandi469</a></p>
<p>The UNODC reports that in the US, male same-sex partner homicides occur twelve times more than female. Source:- <a href="https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/gsh/Booklet_5.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/gsh/Booklet_5.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com</a></p>
<p>This suggests gay men may overlook or fear reporting abuse.</p>
<p>★Another CDC report people like to mention is the (CDC NISVS 2016–2017) which found that lifetime prevalence of intimate partner violence to be: Lesbian women: 56.3% Heterosexual women: 46.3% Bisexual women: 69.3% This includes contact sexual violence (CSV), physical violence, and/or stalking. What we learn from this is, where perpetrator gender is identified, it is overwhelmingly male, regardless of the woman’s sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Sex of Perpetrator: (Contact Sexual Violence)</p>
<p>-Over 72% of lesbian victims reported only having male perpetrators; 1 in 5 (20%) had both male and female perpetrators.</p>
<p>-Over 74% of bisexual women victims reported only having male perpetrators; 1 in 6 (16.7%) had both male and female perpetrators.</p>
<p>-Over 89% of heterosexual women victims had only male perpetrators and .5% had only female perpetrators.</p>
<p>-75.3% of gay men reported only having male perpetrators 1 in 6 had both male and female perpetrators.</p>

<p>Looking back on it, I’m quite disappointed in the quality of all of this data. Recording is sloppy, very few sources include error info (like ± X), lack of age breakdowns, IPV definitions changing, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah, this was always true, including when you first brought up this topic asserting that lesbians are more abusive.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the reddit post has been deleted now, so I can’t review more of their links in detail. I read through several of them before posting and they didn’t seem glaringly false but I’m not totally surprised to hear there were issues.</p>
<p>Looking at the actual ONS data that commenter linked, yeah, it has all of the same issues I raised when you first brought up this topic. Notably, it contains <strong>no data</strong> (as far as I can see… am I missing it?) on <strong>perpetrators</strong>.</p>
<p>If all of the deleted post’s links and the article that they shared ultimately just circle back to this data set, then this probably isn’t anything new or interesting. In which case I guess it doesn’t matter much that they deleted it. My bad for not realizing that was the case.</p>
<p>It’s worth emphasizing that this data <strong>doesn’t</strong> say that lesbians are more likely to commit IPV, or that lesbian relationships have higher rates of IPV. It has never said that, previously or now. I don’t know of any data that does say that.</p>
<p>This data, and every other set I’ve looked at, only says that people who identify as lesbian or bisexual have higher incidents of experiencing IPV over a specific timeframe (the past 12 months for the data you linked). But they could still have experienced IPV from male partners (since most lesbians and bisexuals have had male partners in the past.)</p>
<p>That is an important distinction that is almost always glossed over by people who want to use the data to claim lesbians are mentally unwell and abusive (as was done recently, when a lesbian was murdered by ICE, which I believe is what prompted the reddit thread).</p>
<p>One note about the quality of the data… it may be sloppy, but it’s also important to recognize that <strong>the people doing this data collection were not interested in the same things as you.</strong> So in that sense, it isn’t necessarily fair to say it is sloppy because it lacks details that you want it to have. (It might still be sloppy for other reasons.)</p>
<p>When this topic came up previously, I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This makes sense in the context of the studies, since most of these studies were doing something more like gathering life data and less like trying to prove that queer people are dysfunctional.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an important point so I want to reiterate it.</p>
<p>This data is collected and framed entirely around the victims. My guess would be the reason is something like determining how to allocate resources, what communities to reach out to, and other similar questions that largely revolve around strategies to best help victims.</p>
<p>The data isn’t being collected to be used as a political weapon, and it’s not being collected by police investigating abuse, so there’s no reason it would focus on perpetrators.</p>
<p>When you decouple it from political weaponization and assumptions about perpetrators, the data isn’t very surprising IMO. That reddit poster you quoted called it “shocking” but I disagree.</p>
<p>LGBTQ people have higher rates of experiencing abuse. They have higher rates of being abused by their family, by their friends, etc. Being queer is not always easy. Heteronormative society isn’t very nice to queer people.</p>
<p>And perhaps when heteronormative society isn’t nice to people, it increases their chance of identifying as LGBTQ. That can be a controversial claim in LGBTQ spaces (e.g. the idea that some women might become lesbian or bisexual because they experienced abuse from men and are afraid of men and want to change their relationship options) because it implies sexuality is not entirely innate, but I don’t mind speculating about that possibility.</p>

</aside>
<p>That is one possibility. I wouldn’t claim that there are <em>zero</em> LGBTQ abusers.</p>
<p>Although… note that a girl who thought she was straight, tried to break up with her boyfriend because she realized she was a lesbian, was assaulted by the boyfriend when she broke up with him, then was kicked out of her home for being gay and entered into a non-abusive lesbian relationship would present as <strong>the exact same person</strong> in these studies. e.g. “Lesbian who experienced IPV within the last 12 months.”</p>
<p>And that is a pretty common story for queer people.</p>

</aside>
<p>Maybe. I grew up in a very liberal part of the US. Deciding I was queer was pretty easy and low-stakes for me when I was young. As an adult I decided to join one of the only queer subtypes that <em>was</em> still considered weird and bad, but even that wasn’t too difficult for me personally.</p>
<p>I used to be skeptical of the idea that things were still really bad for queer people in much of the US. I naively thought that was overblown. I now think I was wrong and things are still quite bad. I am a bit skeptical of your claim for a similar reason: I think you may just be blind to it, or naively dismissive. But you also might be right, I don’t know the specifics of what it’s like where you live.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Thanks. I’m happy to accept that the IPV same-sex couple stuff I posted is flawed.</p>
<p>Looking back on it, I’m quite disappointed in the quality of all of this data. Recording is sloppy, very few sources include error info (like ± X), lack of age breakdowns, IPV definitions changing, etc.</p>
<p>Even the reddit post is sloppy. Multiple dead links and at least one article behind a paywall (did the post author just read the abstract?).</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1q98p8v/comment/nyvkjv5/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">a commenter pointed out</a> (replying to OP)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Worth noting that the stats cited in your screenshot and the first half of your post are cherry picked by the article and misrepresentative.</p>
<p>ONS (the source the article uses but does not cite or link to) publishes their data for each year and you can look at the stats yourself: <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/domesticabuseprevalenceandvictimcharacteristicsappendixtables" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/domesticabuseprevalenceandvictimcharacteristicsappendixtables</a></p>
<p>The tabloid article you cite that references their data exclusively references the 2024 dataset which is the only year where gay women have a lower rate than hetero women. If you look at the data across all the other years, this number is very clearly an outlier, with lesbian rates usually falling between 8-15% and almost always nearly equal with gay men.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(If you want to look at the linked <a href="http://ons.gov.uk" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">ons.gov.uk</a> data btw, I found it on table 4 (scroll down) on the latest data at least)</p>
<p>Continuing with that commenter’s post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2019, the lesbian rate was 10.2% compared to 7.3% of hetero women, 3.7% of hetero men, and 5.1% of gay men. (and 12/17 for bi women/men)</p>
<p>In 2025, the lesbian rate was 13.0% compared to 8.4% of hetero women, 5.9% of hetero men, and 15.5% of gay men.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> this uses the ‘any domestic abuse’ stats (which includes family) instead of partner stats. Since it includes 16-19 years old, it also includes e.g., a straight dad threatening his gay son or something. So it’s not even directly responding to what reddit OP was saying.</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/uploads/default/original/2X/0/009cd5b160d882f9b29fd211605be81da71d3192.png" data-download-href="https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/uploads/default/009cd5b160d882f9b29fd211605be81da71d3192" title="image"><img src="https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/uploads/default/original/2X/0/009cd5b160d882f9b29fd211605be81da71d3192.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="5q12S2YxbnRdxWa2EQvzCF9FOa" width="690" height="317" data-dominant-color="F5F5F5"></a></div><p></p>
<p>(Note re screenshot: a bunch of less relevant rows are hidden)</p>
<p>continuing reddit comment for completeness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you average the rates across multiple years, we see a clear pattern. Hetero men/women are about 40% less than gay men/women which are usually about 60% less than bisexual men/women.</p>
<p>This reinforces the data from the CDC study, and also from the other report you cite later, which asserts that young people have the highest rates. But also we see a very consistent pattern, bisexual people, of all genders, have shockingly higher rates than both gay and hetero populations.</p>
<p>If we take the ONS data across all years, the rates from highest to lowest are: Bi Women → Bi Men → Gay Women → Gay Men → Hetero Women → Hetero Men</p>
<p>I don’t know how the ONS gathers their data, what the impact of under/over reporting is, or any other factors that might impact this data, but we should be clear about what the data actually says.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Anyway, going back to what you originally said (“queer people in general are better at relationships on average”), I now think IPV isn’t a great way to judge that. For one, actually experiencing IPV isn’t the average experience. There’s also all kinds of confounding factors, like if an abuser wanted to find a new victim, someone young kicked out of home for being gay is vulnerable and a potential target.</p>
<p>You and I also might have quite different experiences of what the average non-queer relationship is like (particularly religiosity around where I live is much lower than in the US, so “traditional” relationships here might be a lot less traditional compared to the US).</p>
<p>All-in-all, I think how good people are on average at relationships is mostly cultural/memetic and probably independent of sexual orientation.</p>

</aside>
<p>Hey, I just wanted to bring this topic back up since I recently came across a relevant analysis.</p>
<p>Back when you posted this, I did reply with some issues with this claim — such as the fact that at least one major study that started this claim was a poll of lifetime abuse, and so e.g. would include IPV experienced by a lesbian who was previously in a relationship with an abusive man.</p>
<p>I do not think you replied to that so I don’t know if you saw it. But regardless, I thought this was relevant to that topic and might be interesting (either to you, or to anyone who read that discussion and was undecided):</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s another great point. I feel like a lot of haters (not just misogynists but antisemites, immigrant-hating nativists, billionaire-hating socialists, etc.) view themselves as helpless victims of the people they hate.</p>
<p>(Although they often also simultaneously view themselves as strong and powerful—like part of a superior Aryan master race or indomitable proletariat or the stronger/superior gender that allegedly built civilization with their rugged masculinity. So they simultaneously view themselves as superior/stronger but also victimized/weak.)</p>
<p>(Though in some cases that can actually be the case. E.g., the men of the mind in Atlas Shrugged are simultaneously superior/stronger and mistreated.)</p>

            <p>Op says(handwritten by me):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My husband no longer insists when I say No to him in bed, He turns around and falls into a Deep sleep. What does that mean? I Need advice</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Top comment with most likes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It means he cares too much about your wellbeing to divorce you but doesn’t give a shit about you anymore. Congrats, you killed the man’s spirit. Well done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How does the husband care too much about the op’s wellbeing? Like, is he staying so he doesn’t dissapoint her and/or hurt her? Is that a thing? Wellbeing here could mean different things I think, like maybe op’s less happy now and she would be less happy/comfortable/healthy if he did leave for a while at first. Thinking about somebody’s wellbeing sounds hard to do cuz what if one’ partner builds resentment in the op’s situation? They won’t be happy then.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>but doesn’t give a shit about you anymore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If husband doesn’t give a hoot anymore about op then does he that mean he doens’t care about op’s wellbeing anymore? I think the commenter is talking about like sexually or in terms of attraction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Congrats, you killed the man’s spirit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Was the man’s/husband’s spirit killed? Is husband not responsible too in a way here? Like, maybe there’s things he’s in control of. What does commentor think?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Looking at the photos of the modern actresses, it reminded me of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211124200009/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/24/style/yassify-bot-meme.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">yassification</a>. The modern ones look much more like that (IMO).</p>
<p>I wonder if stuff like Snapchat and FaceApp filters influence people’s ideas about beauty and inspire them seek that look. Also I wonder if social media in general is causing people to have more unrealistic beauty standards. (And not just among women, even among guys. Like I don’t think looksmaxxing was a popular thing among guys before. Or working out at the gym for the sake of an aesthetic physique.)</p>
<p>Also, apparently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/09/teenage-girls-tiktok-skincare-regimes-offer-little-to-no-benefit-research-shows" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">even young teens</a> and children(!) are increasingly doing meticulous, laborious skincare routines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there has been a rise in young girls sharing videos of complex skincare routines with moisturisers, toners, acne treatments and anti-ageing products.</p>
<p>… some girls wake up as early as 4.30am to fit in their routines – but pricey, unnecessary and potentially harmful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also <a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/06/tiktok-teen-skin-care-routines-are-harmful" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this study</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>scientists at Northwestern Medicine found girls ages 7 to 18 are using an average of six different products on their faces, with some girls using more than a dozen products. These products tend to be marketed heavily to younger consumers</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Each teen daily skin-care regimen costs an average of $168 (which the authors estimate typically lasts a month depending on the size of the products), with some costing more than $500, the study found.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s so sad that girls as young as 7 feel the need to change how they look.</p>
<p>It’s also an indictment of our culture that young people are focused on improving their bodies/faces rather than their souls/minds. It reminds me of this quote from Allan Bloom’s The Closing of the American Mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As it now stands, students have powerful images of what a perfect body is [e.g., buff guys on magazine covers, extensive TikTok makeup routines, fashion shows] and pursue it incessantly. But deprived of literary guidance, they no longer have any image of a perfect Soul, and hence do not long to have one. They do not even imagine that there is such a thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which in turn reminds me of Cyrano de Bergerac by Rostand:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have a different idea of elegance. I don’t dress like a fop, it’s true, but my moral grooming is impeccable. … I may not cut a stylish figure, but I hold my soul erect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also Epictetus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a sign of a dull mind to dwell upon the cares of the body, to prolong exercise… all your attention must be given to the mind.</p>
</blockquote>

            <p>I found that pretty hilarious.</p>
<p>It made me wonder if bounties like that could work in other contexts. But then it occurred to me that it could incentivize the prosecution of innocent people. Which reminded me of the whole <a href="https://reason.com/2022/02/18/fbi-seized-almost-1-million-from-amy-sterner-carl-nelson-never-charged-them-with-a-crime/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">civil asset forfeiture issue</a>.</p>
<p>I think bounties are sometimes used to motivate citizens to come forward if they have information about a crime though. But I assume it’d usually be a bad incentive if the police themselves are offered bounties.</p>

            <p>My first thought was that maybe he was being petulant and trying to give her the cold shoulder to punish her. (Though that’s a negative interpretation, he could just be respecting her wishes. Idk. I guess I assumed that because of the context of this forum topic and also because the TikTok makes him sound non-communicative.)</p>
<p>I was surprised that the vast majority of the comments were… idk how to describe it… biased against the woman? Like suggesting she should just ~always say yes regardless of how she feels and that the guy would be right to divorce her for not ~always saying yes to sex.</p>
<p>One male commenter said: "we get tired”. But so do women? (In the sense of being sleepy.) A male commenter replied to that comment saying: “They need to bear in mind that we’re also humans”. But he doesn’t seem to be bearing that in mind vis-à-vis women.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>I often think about the fact that we give an old white dude credit for mothers’ hard work, and wonder if Santa is anti-feminist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It hadn’t occurred to me before that Santa could potentially be anti-feminist because attributing stuff to Santa erases some of the mother’s contributions. Since I assume the father also helps pay for the gifts in most cases, it also erases his contribution so I’m not sure that that part is specifically anti-women. (Though I suppose women usually do the work of shopping, wrapping, decorating, etc.) Even Santa’s gender seems coincidental (he’s a guy because of the historical St Nick), plus there’s female equivalents like the Tooth Fairy and even non-human equivalents like the Easter Bunny. (Though maybe in a more feminist world some female equivalent of St Nick would’ve been recognized.)</p>

</aside>
<p>Mmm. ~maybe. I’ve heard complains(?) about how women are told that if a guy is mean to them (usually this justification is used when they’re younger afaik) that means they like them. it could go the other way (guys being told their mean behavior is justified in communicating attraction) though I think in the case of the guy in the video for example i think he’s just gotten comfortable being mean and nasty.</p>

<p>Good question. I assume sometimes guys crash out if the woman they’re simping on doesn’t reciprocate. (Which can make it scary for women to reject guys.)</p>
<p>Now I think of it, I wonder if maybe some guys are “nasty and mean” <em>because</em> they’re attracted to a woman? Like perhaps they’re insecure and assume the woman doesn’t want them so they sort of pre-emptively punish her by being nasty and mean? Or a slightly related idea is sour grapes like oh I don’t even like her anyway.</p>
<p>(This is a totally half-baked guess that’s straight off the top of my head. I haven’t reflected on it. I’m also obviously not an expert on psychology.)</p>

            <p>~yeah, I didn’t watch it fully but they reminded me of an old friend group.</p>
<p>one time a girl joined our game and they started saying mean things just for being a girl. not even being just regularly toxic because she was bad. she didn’t even get a chance to play (like the girl in the video) before they just started being nasty and mean.</p>
<p>its odd though, over time I’ve noticed two reactions to girls in my games. Simp to the girl and try to hit on her or just crash out on them. They got unwanted attention in two different ways. Are these conflicting? Idk</p>
