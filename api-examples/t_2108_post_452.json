The answer is age. An Age-adjusted population studies show that younger people report the highest rates of intimate partner violence. Since they are more likely to recognize abuse and name it. Queer populations skew younger overall. So bisexual and lesbian women are overrepresented in younger age groups, which naturally leads to higher reporting rates. If heterosexual women were examined within the same age ranges as bisexual or lesbian women, their reported IPV rates would be similar or higher than bisexual women.

The more plausible explanation is that heterosexual women are underreporting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e–Many point to the CDC 2010 data claiming gay men report the lowest rates (26%) of intimate partner violence (IPV) , implying women are the main problem. But the reality is more complex. Not all data show gay men with the lowest IPV rates; some studies I mentioned previously indicate higher rates of domestic violence for gay men. But here are a few reasons why some studies, like CDC 2010, might show lower IPV rates for gay men:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1.Lower partnership rates: Gay men are less likely to be in partnered relationships than lesbians. For example, the Williams Institute found about 51% of lesbians are partnered, compared to only 35% of gay men. Since IPV involves partners, fewer partnerships mean fewer reported IPV cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2.Underreporting: Gay men tend to underreport IPV. The CDC shows gay men report 26% IPV prevalence but are 1.7 times more likely to need medical care and 16 times more likely to suffer injury than other groups.
