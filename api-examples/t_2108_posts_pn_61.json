(mostly because of some breakpoint around intelligence I have, the crude way of putting it is that stupidity is a turn off, but it’s even more extreme than that implies. combine that with some other criteria like age (partially due to the desire for multiple kids) and weight and it’s a pretty small proportion of the population.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>What sort of weight criteria are you using?</p>\n<p>If you want women under 120 lbs, you may be confused by memes.</p>\n<p>If you want thin women who are “not overweight”, you may be being misled by things like the BMI scale. A lot of people’s concept of a healthy weight range is too low, and the actual healthy range is higher. There’s controversy here and it’s hard to figure out the ideal and it varies for different individuals, but I feel comfortable in saying that overall our society is misjudging which weights are healthy or unhealthy with a bias favoring lower weights.</p>\n<p>A woman being thin can be a sign of conformity, so looking for that can conflict with looking for intelligence (intelligent people can choose to conform for various reasons but are less likely to).</p>\n<p>Being overweight has multiple causes so it’s important to consider what is causing it for a particular person, unless your aesthetic preferences are really, really important to you so it doesn’t matter what the cause is. But if your aesthetic preferences are that high of a priority, you also have to really prioritize finding someone who will stay thin enough for you in the future, and I think that’s problematic and trying to be really picky about that <em>and</em> about intelligence simultaneously is going to exclude most women. Many women gain weight after pregnancies so wanting kids and thinness can conflict. If this kind of stuff is a really high priority for you, you should discuss it with potential partners. If you wouldn’t leave your wife for gaining weight after having children, then you should reconsider being picky about weight now. If you would leave, you ought to know that, and so should she, and I think you should reconsider either the leaving or the having children (without adoption or surrogacy or something, which are also problematic btw).</p>\n<p>If you’re assuming that most overweight people have poor willpower, and it reflects negatively on their character, I think you’re wrong. Some people called overweight aren’t actually overweight. Others are sick. Others are being harmed by a conventional diet, or by interactions between diet and genes. It can be a lot of things. If you want to filter out anyone who accepted mainstream ideas about what food to eat, or who who has various illnesses, I think you should be consciously aware of what you’re doing and reflect on whether that’s really what you should do.</p>",

You can have a highly principled and consistent view about social issues.</p>\n<p>One thing you might be trying to do is to have a position that is consistent with one “side” of the issue. But neither of the major parties have logically consistent or principled views. So siding your view entirely with one party or “side” isn’t going to get you a logically consistent or principled view.</p>\n<p>Another possibility is you could be thinking that views like “trans women can never participate in any female sports” or “trans women must always be allowed to participate in all female sports” are consistent, principled views.

They aren’t actually consistent in a principled way: they just seem consistent from a naive perspective that isn’t considering underlying principles.</p>\n<p>An example of a view that is naively consistent, but not really principled, would be the view that no sports players should be allowed to take any drugs, medications, or pharmaceuticals.

To be consistent, should we ban <strong>all</strong> drugs from <strong>all</strong> sports? That wouldn’t really be consistent. You have to take into account whether the drug is performance enhancing for that particular sport. You also take into account context like how serious the sport is or what the stakes are. Is it just a group of people playing together for fun, or is it the Olympics?</p>\n<p>Interestingly, I think that one of your replies to me is an example of you not being “consistent” in a way that agrees with the current administration in the US:</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"anonymous45\" data-post=\"47\" data-topic=\"2108\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/a/a87d85/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> anonymous45:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Personally some leeway is warranted because being in the US for 30 years since you were 1yo is as good as naturalization any other way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>The view of the current administration is that <em>all</em> illegal immigrants should be deported.

Well, I say high profile, in the sense that they were public assassinations of public figures, e.g. congresspeople. They were not as high profile in the sense that the federal government did not care about their deaths in the same way, and most online media did not dwell on their assassinations in the same way.</p>\n<p>In general, it is plausible that left wing violence has risen lately.

It’s worth noting that even with that rise, the analysis points out left wing violence is much less lethal on average than right wing violence. I think there are some other takeaways one could immediately gather just from that one graph, much less the study itself.</p>\n<p>One thing I find odd is you cared enough about this to mention it as a thing on your mind in your brain dump, but you did not care enough about it to actually look into the details, or fact-check the YouTube videos you have seen that maybe talked about this issue.</p>\n<p>If you are not in the US and it doesn’t concern you, that’s totally fair IMO. You can choose to focus on other stuff. But if you choose to be concerned by it, and care about it, and be upset about it, then I think it would be wise to also choose to be well-informed on it.</p>\n<p>I am adding bold in the below quote, it was not present in the original post.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"anonymous45\" data-post=\"45\" data-topic=\"2108\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/a/a87d85/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> anonymous45:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>She did not seem to like my position of not trying to police other peoples opinions,</strong> but did acknowledge that it’s important that people are able to make mistakes without having their lives destroyed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>I do find it interesting that you do not like to police peoples’ opinions, but you are seemingly okay or unbothered by e.g. the US Federal Government trying to police peoples’ bodies by trying to ban gender affirming care.</p>\n<p>I don’t think “policing opinions” has a clear definition.

Do you mean because ICE is detaining more people, that would be a point of government contact that people could use to figure out their birth certificates? ICE isn’t really in the business of helping people get their documents in order. They are an entirely different branch of government, and also they don’t seem to be particularly concerned with helping people prove their status. ICE has also detained people who have legal status (either legal immigration status or citizenship), and actually have documents, without giving them a chance to prove their status.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"anonymous45\" data-post=\"21\" data-topic=\"2108\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/a/a87d85/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> anonymous45:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The govt could also proactively advertise to those people and run special programs or whatever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Given that ICE has been detaining people when they show up to their immigration court dates (i.e. when they are “doing it the right way”), I’m not sure that people would actually trust the government if they told people to show up and self declare that they didn’t have proof of their own citizenship.</p>\n<p>Another problem is that it can be really hard to prove citizenship if you weren’t registered at birth. It’s a legitimately hard problem – it’s hard to tell the difference between someone who was born at home and never registered vs someone who was brought into the country as an infant or young child. And one of the groups of people that the government is deporting right now are people who were not born in this country, but were brought here as infants or children. So identifying yourself to the government as potentially part of a group of people that they are currently deporting seems dangerous.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"anonymous45\" data-post=\"21\" data-topic=\"2108\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/a/a87d85/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> anonymous45:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(This might be expensive but it’s a problem that needs to be solved at some point)</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>One perspective that the government might have is that the problem actually does not need to be solved. If you are specifically thinking of black people born during the Jim Crow era, that problem will eventually go away – those people aren’t going to live forever. And if you are thinking of people born more recently, who just didn’t get registered for some other reason, then it’s easy to just blame that on the parents irresponsibility, so not see it as a problem the government needs to put any effort into. If their parents are US citizens, they can derive their citizenship through their parents, even if they weren’t born in the US. So it doesn’t really matter if they don’t have proof of birth in the US. And if their parents aren’t US citizens, then I think that the attitude of the current administration (which is laid out in an executive order) is that they aren’t legitimately US citizens either. So there’s not really a problem for the US government to “solve” there, from that perspective.</p>",

Many forms of sports in the US are private organizations. Even those that are not private are often run at local or state levels, such as high schools. Also, sex differences change across ages.</p>\n<p>Even if you feel that e.g. trans women should not compete at top level professional/Olympic women’s sports, does that mean that trans teenagers should also be disallowed from competing in middle school or high school sports? What about private recreational leagues? Why do all of these sports need to have their rules dictated by the federal executive branch?</p>\n<p>The reason is because of bigotry. Because Trump supporters see trans people as disgusting freaks who need to be punished for their abnormal behavior until they conform with mainstream gender roles. So even if “no trans people in pro sports” might not be a bigoted anti-trans position, Trump’s ban on trans people in women’s sports actually is anti-trans IMO.</p>\n<p>Also, Trump has done much worse than that to trans people via executive orders.

Changing your mind about trans people on Trans Topic A does not have to result in a change in your feelings about Trans Topic B.</p>\n<p>It is possible e.g. to be less transphobic, to not reduce people to gametes, to be willing to respect peoples’ preferences for identification… but still have reservations about trans women competing in professional women’s sports, or about trans women being housed with cis women in prison.</p>\n<p>That is an option! Some people might still get mad and say you are transphobic. They might be right. Or wrong.

Rejecting anti-trans bigotry (which is rampant in most gender critical spaces) does not mean you have to embrace “trans ideology”.</p>\n<p>In general, particularly for the most contentious issues such as gendered sports, you can also just reserve judgment. One reason the most contentious issues come up a lot is that they are weaponized to push people in particular directions. In general, the modern conservative movement has been heavily motivated to push the most extreme trans perspectives into the public consciousness because these issues trigger revulsion responses in a lot of \"people. Trans people have been an effective boogeyman to motivate conservatives and lots of conservative leaning centrists.</p>\n<p>If you care to investigate it yourself (I am not recommending this, only do it if you genuinely want to) and talk to lots of different trans people from varied backgrounds, you may find there are different perspectives on these issues even in trans communities. Many trans people do <em>not</em> have strong feelings about the more contentious issues, or may even have less PC views of those issues. Not every trans person is a radical agent for a postmodern trans ideology.</p>",

While no examples come to mind for adults, the fact that some women probably have a harder time because people are trying to develop a trans-dar and mistake them for trans has occurred to me independently and I have sympathy for these women. It’s actually one of the reasons I’m a bit anti-trans. I’m not sure how to resolve that except by doing the thing I’m fighting against which is just treat people based on one’s best guess for how they want to be treated (gender-wise). I think that’s what is wanted, at least.</p>\n<p>One thing I don’t know how to resolve is the parts of trans culture I think are bad for other reasons. Like people basically pretending to be trans to get off and/or do things I’d consider to be sexually assaulting women (e.g., exposing male genitals in female changing rooms). I still think that’s bad but I also don’t think it’s right to demonize a group of people because of a few bad actors (that’s one issue I have with the way the left treats the right, for example).</p>\n<p>I also don’t like the compelled speech aspect of treating misgendering as hate speech. I don’t know the extent to which current laws in various western nations do that, but there are a lot of worrying things like speech laws in the UK and Germany.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"anonymous105\" data-post=\"31\" data-topic=\"2108\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/a/8797f3/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> anonymous105:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If we get sufficient technology to change the gamete expression (e.g. to give an AMAB person ovaries), then we can pivot to something else, like some futuristic gene scan that tells us what their gamete expression was at birth.

Just that it’s bad faith? (If so, what about the people who aren’t making the argument in bad faith?)</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Because it is not a coherent argument. The only use cases for it are bad faith, or people who got duped into believing it in good faith and don’t understand it.</p>\n<p>It is a fuzzy concept intentionally to give wiggle room to dance away from arguments without really countering them. What does “organized around” actually mean?</p>\n<p>If it was actually about the gametes alone, the criteria was just “can produce sperm/eggs” then that has a clear objective definition. But it excludes lots of cis people so it’s kinda untenable and makes you look like a jerk and an idiot — basically saying “if you are sterile, you’re no longer a man/woman.”</p>\n<p>I think some far right christian conservatives actually bite the bullet on this, and just say “if you can’t have kids that makes you less of a woman,” so I have mild respect their (evil) principled position.</p>\n<p>But most people know how bad that looks and won’t commit to that. So then you end up in this goofy “organized around” weasel space. But as far as I can tell it is just a proxy for sex characteristics, with a layer of deniability so that if trans people manage to jump the hoops and change their sex characteristics you can say “no you still don’t count.”</p>\n<p>You yourself have betrayed this in our discussion, e.g.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>if not all the roles of the original are fulfilled (including sexual reproduction), then what are they but glorified sex toys?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Looking pretty bad for sterile people.</p>\n<p>I think any specific argument you put forth using this gametes idea will fall on one side or the other… either it will be an argument that focuses on reproduction and also excludes sterile people, or it will be an argument that focuses on sex characteristics and so includes trans people who sufficiently change their sex characteristics.</p>\n<p>So the gametes idea isn’t good. The arguments don’t really work, they just create a sort of interchangeable motte-and-bailey where either side (reproduction/sex characteristics) can serve as the motte or the bailey in any given situation.</p>",
