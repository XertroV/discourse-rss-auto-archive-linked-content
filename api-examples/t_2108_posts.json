        "cooked": "<p>I read the book earlier this week (at Elliot’s suggestion) and overall was glad I read it. I liked that it was usually fairly clear about definitions and the main points it was making. Particularly I feel like I have a much clearer idea about what patriarchy is and why it is bad. I’m particularly sympathetic to the idea that controlling other people is bad and we should want to avoid doing that and resisting it. I also found that I could identify some examples of patriarchy that I couldn’t before (now that I knew what to look for).</p>\n<p>I have a lot of thoughts on the book and will break these up over multiple posts.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>From my notes, I noted at least 4 definitions/descriptions of patriarchy:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The name we use for social inequality against women and girls is “patriarchy”. Second-wave feminists (along with third- and fourth-wave feminists) want to smash patriarchy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The core of patriarchy is control over women and girls’ sexuality, but it cannot tolerate the healthy development of boys’ sexuality any more than it can girls’.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><em>Patriarchy</em> <strong>literally</strong> means ‘rule by fathers’.</li>\n<li>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Feminist writers adopted ‘patriarchy’ to refer to power dynamics in modern society more broadly</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>2 and 4 appeal to me particularly (because I do not like control over others and power dynamics embedded in social dynamics).</p>\n<p>Two common examples of patriarchy I noted down were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The ‘natural’ hierarchy of a household being <code>god &gt; husband &gt; wife &gt; children</code> that I’ve seen mentioned by a number of redpill type influencers. (I’m not religious but one can replace god with a moral standard that is primarily interpreted by husbands and then applied or imposed on the rest of the family.) I was sympathetic to this only insofar as I would settle for a traditional relationship over no relationship, but it isn’t my preference. (I’m single atm and had been thinking about this on and off for the past year or two)</li>\n<li>The idea that fathers/brothers do work ‘filtering’ out bad boyfriends/partners for their daughters/sisters. I was sympathetic to this idea before reading BFITF, and am less so now. (I’m not totally against it because I think family and friends <em>in general</em> can play a positive role in helping both young men and women avoid bad partners and problematic relationships, but now I think it’s much more important to pay attention to patriarchal motivations or justifications for that kind of guidance/advice.)</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group quote-modified\" data-username=\"Elliot\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"2108\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/user_avatar/discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/elliot/48/14_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> Elliot:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A lot of men who claim to be feminists actually turn out to be misogynists.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Yeah, I liked the point about how some men see being feminist as a “noble sacrifice”, which implies they’re losing out on something.<br>\nIt reminds me of how democrats sometimes claim voter ID laws discriminate against minorities because minorities have some trouble getting ID (even though they don’t), which exposes some racist views. (The similarities being that the men and democrats both claim to be virtuous based on views that have underlying bigotry issues.)</p>",

        "cooked": "<p>One thing I did not like about the book was chapter 4 (gender) which felt like postmodern gender ideology / trans ideology was being forced in there. There are numerous issues with this IMO.</p>\n<p>For one: the (deliberate?*) coopting of language to serve an ideological agenda.</p>\n<p><sup>* I don’t mean GWS (the author) is doing this deliberately, but that gender activists (including academics) might be doing it deliberately.</sup></p>\n<p>The word ‘gender’ was literally synonymous with ‘sex’ until the 60s or so. Webster’s 1913 has “<strong>2.</strong> Sex, male or female. [Obs. or Colloq.]” (and similar in Webster’s 1828).<br>\nFrom my own research, it seems like <a href=\"https://www.etymonline.com/word/sex\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><em>sex</em></a> is a slightly older word than <a href=\"https://www.etymonline.com/word/gender\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><em>gender</em></a> (late 14c. vs early 15c.) for referring to male/female. (“Gender” meaning <em>type</em> predates both to about 13c. according to the linked source)<br>\n‘Sex’ was the main word for male/female until the (late?) 1800s when it also began being used to mean intercourse which explains why <em>gender</em> became the more common term.<br>\nI’m opposed to the coopting of the word ‘gender’ to mean something new and different. Typically it seemed like we used noun phrases to be specific when we wanted to talk about something gender related that wasn’t gender itself (e.g., <em>gender roles</em>, <em>gender identity</em>, etc).<br>\nContemporarily, it seems like ‘gender’ is now used <em>interchangeably and ambiguously</em> to refer to something like gender identity but less restrictive and amorphous.</p>\n<p>I think one can demonstrate this issue by considering all uses of ‘gender’ in a work like BFITF and replacing <em>every</em> instance with something more specific: ‘biological sex’ for male/female, and ‘gender roles’ or ‘gender identity’ for the other instances. My prediction is that this will show inconsistencies in BFITF (and other TRA* content) including ‘bait and switch’ type tactics where someone starts by referring to biological sex and then switches to a different meaning.</p>\n<p><sup>* TRA = Trans Rights Activists; I maybe use it too generally to mean any new-gender ideologues</sup></p>\n<p>Personally I separate (in my head) usages of gender into the traditional definition and ‘genfeelia’* (a word I made up to mean “how one feels about ones gender”), and so it makes it quite obvious when this kind of bait and switch happens.</p>\n<p><sup>* One argument against ‘genfeelia’ is that it’s perjorative, which I don’t think is true, but I can see how some trans people might see it that way because they’d see it as reducing something fundamental about themselves to simply ideas in their head (which is what it is, but they want it to be more than that). GWS’s argument actually supports this to some degree with the points about similarities in brain size.</sup></p>\n<p>I can’t remember anywhere that BFITF swaps out ‘sex’ for genfeelia, but that’s a common thing that happens with TRAs, e.g., “sex assigned at birth”. Sex is not ‘assigned’ (except maybe in very rare intersex cases, but AFAIK most intersex cases aren’t that ambiguous and the body is still dominantly organized around one kind of gamete even if there are some developmental anomalies). Gender-as-genfeelia can be assigned, but talking about it like that makes it very obvious that we’re talking about a psychological thing not physiological.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>(Note: in my notes I refer to the author as GWS rather than Stone. I can change if it’s problematic but I don’t think it is.)</p>\n<p>GWS also doesn’t address the conflict with TERFs, who are usually gender critical* as far as I understand. TERFs don’t like patriarchy but reject the idea that you can switch gender however you like. (TERFs are feminists like JK Rowling and possibly best known for opposing men being allowed in women’s bathrooms and changing rooms.)</p>\n<p><sup>* <em>Gender critical</em> is the main school of thought opposing trans ideology from logical, physiological, psychological, and philosophical bases.</sup></p>\n<p>The fact this conflict exists is a strong argument against including <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span> in the list, IMO.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Humans have two genders, ‘men’ and ‘women’.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While this does seem to be a foundational idea of patriarchy, so are lots of ideas about family and sexual reproduction and the like. It seems like the list is meant to be the smallest set of controversial ideas which is why lots of other foundational ideas of patriarchy aren’t included (because those ideas are shared with feminism and other -isms etc more broadly).</p>\n<p>I think <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2</span> is problematic also:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>We can reliably tell men from women by their biological, psychological, and social traits.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, of course, because ‘man’ and ‘woman’ describe biological sex. It is typically trivial to infer which gamete type a person’s body is organized around.</p>\n<p>This only makes sense as a point if <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2</span> does not consider biological sex, but rather considers genfeelia, gender roles, and gender self-identification. This is a sneaky bait and switch. If it were put more correctly, then its nature would be more obvious, e.g., <em>we can reliably tell how someone feels about their gendered expressions by their biological, psychological, and social traits.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>I have more thoughts on all this but will need to write them up later. Also I realize I’ve mostly talked about the points in ch3 instead of ch4, but ch4 depends on all this pretext.</p>",

I think there are many contexts where you could look at someone’s biological, psychological, or social traits and then you might <strong>infer their biological sex incorrectly</strong>. You could see breasts or a vagina (biological), see them being agreeable or nurturing or sensitive (psychological), see them wearing a dress and makeup or have long hair styled in a feminine way (social). All of that could lead you to infer that they are a woman. But actually they might have XY chromosomes, so your inference was wrong.</p>\n<p>I think this reveals a big problem with your insistence that man &amp; woman are terms that primarily pertain to biological sex and chromosomes. It seems like the terms man and woman correspond just as much with gender expression in society.</p>\n<p>In general I think your assessment of “postmodern gender ideology / trans ideology” is a bit confused and incorrect.

I will go ahead an assert an answer: they do not. They assign sex based on the gender expression they can identify in the infant. Of biological, psychological, social traits that signal gender expression, only one of those really comes up much in infants: biological.</p>\n<p>For example, someone with XY chromosomes and complete androgen insensitivity will be assigned “female” at birth. Because they will develop a vulva and other biological traits we associate with “woman.” They will <strong>not</strong> be assigned the sex or gender that corresponds with their chromosomes.</p>\n<p>When things are ambiguous, doctors consistently assign the gender and sex that they intuitively guess best corresponds with the biological expression of the infant.

(I have some guesses. I have seen some biased coverage of this issue, so think that maybe you listened to that. Or maybe you have personally had easy experiences, and think that it is the same for all people in all states.) I am replying with some general points that apply to this issue, without a lot of detail, since I’m not really sure where your disagreement lies.</p>\n<p>One issue is that it’s harder for lower income people to get IDs. This isn’t direct discrimination against minorities, but it does disproportionately affect minorities. That includes things like DMV offices being in locations that are inaccessible by transit or walking, keeping very short hours, making it hard both to schedule an appointment or do a walk in, and having extensive ID requirements that are hard to meet. There are also issues that affect minorities more, like having fewer offices, or offices with worse hours, in areas with high minority populations.</p>\n<p>People also end up in a catch-22 where they need a birth certificate to get a photo ID, but they need a photo ID to get a birth certificate. People have had issues with their older birth certificates not being accepted, or having a hospital issued certificate that wasn’t a real birth certificate, but not realizing that. And if they don’t have a photo ID, it can be hard to get a copy of their birth certificate. This kind of issue will generally be harder for low income people to deal with, since the bureaucratic processes can require both time and money to figure out how to navigate the system.</p>\n<p>There is another issue which specifically applies to African Americans who were born in the segregated states during the Jim Crow era (so, before the mid 1960s). Many people were denied access to proper hospitals because of segregation, so were born at home. Some of those people did not have their births properly registered for various reasons (including illiteracy, lack of knowledge and poverty, but also barriers and resistance from government officials to register their births). So there are black people alive in the US right now who don’t have birth certificates because of the explicit legal racism that existed at the time of their birth.</p>\n<p>I don’t think that it is “racist” to recognize that these kinds of issues exist, and that some of them specifically apply to black people (or potentially other people of color born during segregation), while others have a disproportionate effect on minorities.</p>",

(I think this (inducing)  is possible for many mental illnesses and also stuff like romantic feelings)</p>\n<p>Like, within a gender ideology world view, I’ve long thought that the logical implication was infinite genders (which GWS mentions too). The problem with that is that they’re all meaningless and made up. IMO that’s demonstrated by all the neo-pronoun nonsense. I know someone who identifies as an AI for example. Not just a single AI but a system of them (so uses plural pronouns, too). I am not sure how anyone can seriously see that as anything other than mental illness. I feel sympathetic in that I think living in a fiction like that is a bad way to live and that the person in question is trapped by bad ideas. The political and social stuff that’s associated with affirmation only makes the situation worse and harder to escape.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"anonymous105\" data-post=\"6\" data-topic=\"2108\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/a/8797f3/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> anonymous105:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But actually they might have XY chromosomes, so your inference was wrong.</p>\n<p>I think this reveals a big problem with your insistence that man &amp; woman are terms that primarily pertain to biological sex and chromosomes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>I didn’t mention chromosomes (deliberately) and I think using XX or XY to determin sex/gender is a bit reductve.

Using XX/XY chromosomes as the determinant is a crude approximation for that. So it’s not about the particular sets of genes themselves but rather their expression combined with biological development.

I disagree that it’s “just as much” these days (but that depends on how you define man/woman). Luckily, though, the terms trans woman for trans-identified males, and vice versa, seem more common* than woman/man (and describe much more specific expression too). I say luckily because otherwise the words become mostly meaningless. e.g., “I’m attracted to women” would cease to be correct for the most people who would say that (and vice versa) if we relaxed the definitions. Most people would need to say something like “I’m attracted to cis-gendered biological females” instead. We’d need the ‘biological’ qualifier because TRAs are pushing for stuff like having M/F changed to F/M on their passport/ID next to ‘sex’, which would be the complete erosion of any meaning of these words and a total break from the biological meaning.</p>\n<p><sup>* <em>trans-identified (fe)male</em> is much less common as a term and I’ve only heard it from gender critical people.</sup></p>\n<p>I also think the TRA’s opinions about this are sexist because they see gender as a costume — that it’s more important how you act than what you are; that men can understand what it’s like to be a woman just by dressing up.</p>\n<p>(That said, if one can pass then one probably can learn some things. VladNCL (i think) on YouTube is a big Russian guy who has learnt to dress up very convincingly. He has some eye opening videos about sexual harassment women face (videos of him in Cyprus and Vegas come to mind). Those kind of videos do more to convince me that there are salient issues around sexism than any pro-trans content.)</p>\n<p>As an aside re the terms trans woman and trans man, I think it’s curious that the adjective modifies the noun in the way it does. From a grammatical point of view, ‘trans man’ should be synonymous with trans-identified male. The postmodernists won that one though. (And I use the word ‘won’ because that’s how they see it, which kind of forces the rest of us to play the same game. Everything is political when one problematic group of intellectuals makes anything and everything political. <em>(thinking) hmm, maybe that’s unfair to say and just an excuse to impose my views on others.</em>)</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"anonymous105\" data-post=\"6\" data-topic=\"2108\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/a/8797f3/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> anonymous105:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In general I think your assessment of “postmodern gender ideology / trans ideology” is a bit confused and incorrect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>I would like to be wrong because I feel a lot of negative emotions about how things are and I don’t think that’s good for me or healthy.<br>\nI wouldn’t like to be erroneously convinced that I’m wrong though (which would be like living in a fantasy).</p>",

There are claims we don’t need to give illegal immigrants due process because the constitution doesn’t apply to them. I don’t agree with that, but even if it were true, then some of the people denied due process would inevitably be citizens who never get a chance to prove they are citizens. There is no way to fully deny illegal immigrants due process without accidentally denying due process to some citizens or legal immigrants.</p>",

Your statement did not make sense to me, <strong>because trans people exist.</strong></p>\n<p>The sentence in this case is more like if you said “people don’t eat pumpkins” and I said “pumpkin pie exists.” That isn’t any big societal assertion about the validity of pumpkin pie.

Both sentences are wrong, but I want to focus especially on the bold sentence.</p>\n<p>To try to demonstrate why it’s wrong, I said this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think there are many contexts where you could look at someone’s biological, psychological, or social traits and then you might <strong>infer their biological sex incorrectly</strong>. You could see breasts or a vagina (biological), see them being agreeable or nurturing or sensitive (psychological), see them wearing a dress and makeup or have long hair styled in a feminine way (social). All of that could lead you to infer that they are a woman. But actually they might have XY chromosomes, so your inference was wrong.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don’t think the argument here is changed in any meaningful way if you swap out the reference to chromosomes with a references to gametes.</p>\n<p>Why do you think reframing it to gametes matters?</p>\n<p>I’m wondering if my argument above isn’t clear enough? I can try to rephrase it a bit.</p>\n<p>My point is that some people (such as trans people, but others as well) make it so that, to the extent it <strong>is</strong> trivial to infer whether someone is a man or a woman, it is <strong>not</strong> trivial to infer which gamete type a person’s body is organized around.</p>\n<p>If you see someone with breasts and long hair and makeup and soft skin wearing a dress and carrying a baby and speaking softly… you will likely infer that is a woman. But you actually do not know anything about that person’s gametes. They might be a trans woman on hormones. Even if you see them naked and they have a vulva, it might be surgically constructed. Or they might have a vulva but no womb or ovaries due to being a “male” with androgen insensitivity.</p>\n<p>There are multiple possibilities. You can infer that they are a “woman”, because they are showing biological, psychological, and social traits are culturally associated with women. But your inference that they are a biological female could be wrong. Its chance of being correct is going to be related to how many of those other types of people happen to exist in the same area as you, or something.</p>\n<p>I have a <strong>LOT</strong> more disagreements with the rest of your post. I think it’s hard to keep up, because from my perspective the post I initially replied to had many more errors on many more topics than I was willing to engage with immediately… and now, in this more focused discussion, you continued to introduce a bunch more stuff I disagree with. But most of it is not really related to the argument I was making, as far as I can tell.</p>\n<p>So let’s try to get through this section first.

They might have some barriers in their way, like some states want you to have a photo ID to get your birth certificate, but if the reason you need the birth certificate is because you are trying to get a photo ID, that can be a bit of a catch-22 situation. Also in the US, the general process to get a birth certificate is that you go to the county you were born in to get it, which can be difficult. It is also possible to order most birth certificates online, but that is usually through a third party with extra costs and its own verification process, and that can take a long time.</p>\n<p>The second group I was talking about – people who were born outside of hospitals and never registered their birth – don’t even have their birth registered with the state, so no birth certificate exists for them. There are ways they can potentially get one, but it can be a very long process, requiring a lot of work, finding old childhood records (e.g. school records, immunization records, other medical records, etc), going to court, etc, to get their birth registered with the state.</p>\n<p>There isn’t really an easy fix for making sure that people whose births were never registered can get a birth certificate. This has also happened to people besides just black people during segregation, like people with “hippie” or “sovereign citizen” parents who just didn’t register their kids, or poor people who couldn’t afford a hospital birth and then for some reason also didn’t register the birth.</p>",

Not just a single AI but a system of them (so uses plural pronouns, too). I am not sure how anyone can seriously see that as anything other than mental illness. I feel sympathetic in that I think living in a fiction like that is a bad way to live and that the person in question is trapped by bad ideas.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Another thing you could see it as is a <em>coping mechanism</em>. In general, you shouldn’t be picky about how victims cope.</p>\n<p>Patriarchy harms women and men. Both “traditional” gender roles are toxic. So, trying to escape harm and stereotypes, people may not want to identify as a woman or a man.</p>\n<p>Also “identifies as an AI” could mean a wide variety of things and play a wide variety of roles in someone’s life. It could be similar to “AI” = “robot” = agender = not man and not woman. It could be about being or trying to be less emotional. It could be a big deal that affects a lot of their life or a minor rebellion that only affects some intellectual conversations or a sort of mantra to remind them of a few of their values.</p>\n<p>“living in a fiction” sounds bad but it’s what everyone inevitably does all the time. We’re all fallible and have mistaken beliefs.</p>\n<p>Both the “man” and “woman” gender roles could be called fictions too. You could see it as replacing one fiction with another instead of as a “mental illness”. You could see it as an attempt to get less fictional by having a more modern, scientific, technological concept instead of more of an old, biblical Adam and Eve story.</p>\n<p>Also, in some sort of Popperian/Deutschian epistemology sense, AIs are just people. They’re just intelligences like we are (so are intelligent aliens). They aren’t special. They aren’t a fundamentally new category of thing. Their minds wouldn’t work fundamentally differently than ours. But <em>this goes both ways</em>. If AIs are like us, then we’re like AIs. So maybe it’s not so weird for someone to reject our culture’s artificial distinction between “natural” and “artificial” intelligences.</p>\n<p>People generally have all sorts of beliefs that aren’t strictly logical. What stands out about this view is that it’s unconventional and you’re interpreting it as challenging a tradition you seem to want to defend. It’s widespread to have a negative attitude to outliers, dissent, non-conformity, fictions, myths, ideas that sound dumb, etc. These kinds of negative attitudes take many forms. I think they’re a major problem because they suppress both good and bad ideas, not just bad ideas, and they suppress debate, critical discussion and curiosity. And when these attitudes lead to dismissiveness and delegitimizing disagreements as non-disagreements, that gets in the way of learning and error correction even when the dismissed idea actually is incorrect.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"anonymous45\" data-post=\"12\" data-topic=\"2108\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/a/a87d85/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> anonymous45:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The overwhelming majority of human progress has thus been made under patriarchy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>We’ve had plenty of racism and superstition too.
