        "cooked": "<p>One thing I did not like about the book was chapter 4 (gender) which felt like postmodern gender ideology / trans ideology was being forced in there. There are numerous issues with this IMO.</p>\n<p>For one: the (deliberate?*) coopting of language to serve an ideological agenda.</p>\n<p><sup>* I don’t mean GWS (the author) is doing this deliberately, but that gender activists (including academics) might be doing it deliberately.</sup></p>\n<p>The word ‘gender’ was literally synonymous with ‘sex’ until the 60s or so. Webster’s 1913 has “<strong>2.</strong> Sex, male or female. [Obs. or Colloq.]” (and similar in Webster’s 1828).<br>\nFrom my own research, it seems like <a href=\"https://www.etymonline.com/word/sex\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><em>sex</em></a> is a slightly older word than <a href=\"https://www.etymonline.com/word/gender\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><em>gender</em></a> (late 14c. vs early 15c.) for referring to male/female. (“Gender” meaning <em>type</em> predates both to about 13c. according to the linked source)<br>\n‘Sex’ was the main word for male/female until the (late?) 1800s when it also began being used to mean intercourse which explains why <em>gender</em> became the more common term.<br>\nI’m opposed to the coopting of the word ‘gender’ to mean something new and different. Typically it seemed like we used noun phrases to be specific when we wanted to talk about something gender related that wasn’t gender itself (e.g., <em>gender roles</em>, <em>gender identity</em>, etc).<br>\nContemporarily, it seems like ‘gender’ is now used <em>interchangeably and ambiguously</em> to refer to something like gender identity but less restrictive and amorphous.</p>\n<p>I think one can demonstrate this issue by considering all uses of ‘gender’ in a work like BFITF and replacing <em>every</em> instance with something more specific: ‘biological sex’ for male/female, and ‘gender roles’ or ‘gender identity’ for the other instances. My prediction is that this will show inconsistencies in BFITF (and other TRA* content) including ‘bait and switch’ type tactics where someone starts by referring to biological sex and then switches to a different meaning.</p>\n<p><sup>* TRA = Trans Rights Activists; I maybe use it too generally to mean any new-gender ideologues</sup></p>\n<p>Personally I separate (in my head) usages of gender into the traditional definition and ‘genfeelia’* (a word I made up to mean “how one feels about ones gender”), and so it makes it quite obvious when this kind of bait and switch happens.</p>\n<p><sup>* One argument against ‘genfeelia’ is that it’s perjorative, which I don’t think is true, but I can see how some trans people might see it that way because they’d see it as reducing something fundamental about themselves to simply ideas in their head (which is what it is, but they want it to be more than that). GWS’s argument actually supports this to some degree with the points about similarities in brain size.</sup></p>\n<p>I can’t remember anywhere that BFITF swaps out ‘sex’ for genfeelia, but that’s a common thing that happens with TRAs, e.g., “sex assigned at birth”. Sex is not ‘assigned’ (except maybe in very rare intersex cases, but AFAIK most intersex cases aren’t that ambiguous and the body is still dominantly organized around one kind of gamete even if there are some developmental anomalies). Gender-as-genfeelia can be assigned, but talking about it like that makes it very obvious that we’re talking about a psychological thing not physiological.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>(Note: in my notes I refer to the author as GWS rather than Stone. I can change if it’s problematic but I don’t think it is.)</p>\n<p>GWS also doesn’t address the conflict with TERFs, who are usually gender critical* as far as I understand. TERFs don’t like patriarchy but reject the idea that you can switch gender however you like. (TERFs are feminists like JK Rowling and possibly best known for opposing men being allowed in women’s bathrooms and changing rooms.)</p>\n<p><sup>* <em>Gender critical</em> is the main school of thought opposing trans ideology from logical, physiological, psychological, and philosophical bases.</sup></p>\n<p>The fact this conflict exists is a strong argument against including <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span> in the list, IMO.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Humans have two genders, ‘men’ and ‘women’.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While this does seem to be a foundational idea of patriarchy, so are lots of ideas about family and sexual reproduction and the like. It seems like the list is meant to be the smallest set of controversial ideas which is why lots of other foundational ideas of patriarchy aren’t included (because those ideas are shared with feminism and other -isms etc more broadly).</p>\n<p>I think <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2</span> is problematic also:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>We can reliably tell men from women by their biological, psychological, and social traits.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, of course, because ‘man’ and ‘woman’ describe biological sex. It is typically trivial to infer which gamete type a person’s body is organized around.</p>\n<p>This only makes sense as a point if <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2</span> does not consider biological sex, but rather considers genfeelia, gender roles, and gender self-identification. This is a sneaky bait and switch. If it were put more correctly, then its nature would be more obvious, e.g., <em>we can reliably tell how someone feels about their gendered expressions by their biological, psychological, and social traits.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>I have more thoughts on all this but will need to write them up later. Also I realize I’ve mostly talked about the points in ch3 instead of ch4, but ch4 depends on all this pretext.</p>",

        "cooked": "<p>I read the book earlier this week (at Elliot’s suggestion) and overall was glad I read it. I liked that it was usually fairly clear about definitions and the main points it was making. Particularly I feel like I have a much clearer idea about what patriarchy is and why it is bad. I’m particularly sympathetic to the idea that controlling other people is bad and we should want to avoid doing that and resisting it. I also found that I could identify some examples of patriarchy that I couldn’t before (now that I knew what to look for).</p>\n<p>I have a lot of thoughts on the book and will break these up over multiple posts.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>From my notes, I noted at least 4 definitions/descriptions of patriarchy:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The name we use for social inequality against women and girls is “patriarchy”. Second-wave feminists (along with third- and fourth-wave feminists) want to smash patriarchy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The core of patriarchy is control over women and girls’ sexuality, but it cannot tolerate the healthy development of boys’ sexuality any more than it can girls’.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><em>Patriarchy</em> <strong>literally</strong> means ‘rule by fathers’.</li>\n<li>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Feminist writers adopted ‘patriarchy’ to refer to power dynamics in modern society more broadly</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>2 and 4 appeal to me particularly (because I do not like control over others and power dynamics embedded in social dynamics).</p>\n<p>Two common examples of patriarchy I noted down were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The ‘natural’ hierarchy of a household being <code>god &gt; husband &gt; wife &gt; children</code> that I’ve seen mentioned by a number of redpill type influencers. (I’m not religious but one can replace god with a moral standard that is primarily interpreted by husbands and then applied or imposed on the rest of the family.) I was sympathetic to this only insofar as I would settle for a traditional relationship over no relationship, but it isn’t my preference. (I’m single atm and had been thinking about this on and off for the past year or two)</li>\n<li>The idea that fathers/brothers do work ‘filtering’ out bad boyfriends/partners for their daughters/sisters. I was sympathetic to this idea before reading BFITF, and am less so now. (I’m not totally against it because I think family and friends <em>in general</em> can play a positive role in helping both young men and women avoid bad partners and problematic relationships, but now I think it’s much more important to pay attention to patriarchal motivations or justifications for that kind of guidance/advice.)</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group quote-modified\" data-username=\"Elliot\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"2108\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/user_avatar/discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/elliot/48/14_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> Elliot:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A lot of men who claim to be feminists actually turn out to be misogynists.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Yeah, I liked the point about how some men see being feminist as a “noble sacrifice”, which implies they’re losing out on something.<br>\nIt reminds me of how democrats sometimes claim voter ID laws discriminate against minorities because minorities have some trouble getting ID (even though they don’t), which exposes some racist views. (The similarities being that the men and democrats both claim to be virtuous based on views that have underlying bigotry issues.)</p>",
