Like the adversity is they had to go find some more evidence and their boss doubted them in the middle. Medical drama TV shows often follow the same structure.</p>\n<p><em>Atlas Shrugged</em> and <em>The Fountainhead</em> are more in line with highly respected books for having more adversity, drama, ups and downs, etc. It’s different than a lot of plotlines you’d see with Superman, Star Trek, Law and Order, fanfiction. If you don’t think AS and FH show success as hard, then do any stories (particularly about realistic scenarios, not zombie apocalypses)?</p>\n<p>And <em>We the Living</em> doesn’t have a good ending despite having a deserving hero.</p>",

I think at least Fountainhead is like this — Roark ends the book in a triumphant way, his life is going well, he is doing architecture and he got the girl.</p>\n<p>That is meaningfully different from the setbacks being <strong>superficial</strong>. Many protagonists in successful fiction experience very real, serious setbacks. They get badly injured, or lose their job, or have their reputation smeared, or have close friends die, or get their heart broken, etc. But in most fiction, the protagonist overcomes the setbacks and ends the story in a triumphant way.</p>\n<p>My guess would be the exceptions in either direction — the story ending sadly with the setbacks having broken the protagonist, or the story being an easy experience where most stuff just works out with minimal problems for the protagonist — aren’t uncommon but might be a relative minority. Though it varies some across genres, too.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"Apricus\" data-post=\"4\" data-topic=\"2144\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/user_avatar/discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/apricus/48/855_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> Apricus:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It might also be that movies and media in general make it seem easier to be nice than it actually is in real life.

Not just when the setbacks are superficial/trivial.</p>\n<p>Because by the end of the story things worked out okay. People often are biased to most remember their feeling at the end of a story rather than how they felt throughout it (e.g. when the hero was at their lowest). So if things worked out in the end, I wouldn’t be surprised if many people come away from that feeling like it wasn’t all that bad and they, too, could have done what the protagonist did.</p>",

I think people in general struggle to match values they talk about. This kind of reminds of me something related to Rand. I think Peikoff mentioned how when Atlas Shrugged was first published. He and others (and maybe Rand?) thought the world would get better fast because of the convincingness of Atlas Shrugged. Instead people read it, some (maybe a lot, idk) liked it, said they agreed with it, and changed pmuch nothing on their lives.</p>\n<p>I wonder if it has something to do with something else I’ve heard of before (I think from Rand?): the church mentality (or smth like that). People care about their values only at like important times. Not in their general lives. You go to church and you’ll do charity and stuff. The rest of the week you’re your average self.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"Apricus\" data-post=\"4\" data-topic=\"2144\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/user_avatar/discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/apricus/48/855_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> Apricus:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It might also be that movies and media in general make it seem easier to be nice than it actually is in real life.

I think media makes things feel easier than they are. reading something like Atlas Shrugged or The Fountainhead makes having integrity and being rational easy. I don’t think Rand wrote it in a way that said their easy. But something about reading about it makes it feel easy.</p>",

Ok, what about the people who are good enough at singing high notes, but need to work on having a more consistent tone or sing low notes or soemthing(idk a lot about music).

I think studying something like CF can help with learning to be more tolerant. I think learning resolving conflicts of ideas can help one be more tolerant cuz they take the other side of an argument more into consideration and don’t just shut them down in favor of their idea. But I also think you have to make the connection to be tolerant to others. Idk what psychology or rationality helps with that? I haven’t really researched so there might be some examples.

Partly this is related to main vs. side characters, but I think partly he’s viewed as deserving death for his past mistakes and for being a demon. The mistakes are being a jerk to his family which no one thinks merits the death penalty, especially when done to escape extreme poverty, and also getting involved with demons. Also his death was shown as heroic/altruistic so people see it as more of a happy redemption ending than other scenarios where he’s equally dead and gone. I think the emphasis our culture places on how people die has some connections with military propaganda. While it does matter, sometimes people let it overshadow how big a deal death is, and how the experience of dying and being dead is largely the same regardless (and actually a lot of heroic deaths are more painful in the moments right before death).</span></p>\n<p>Unrelated, the demon hunters are drawn anorexic with video game proportions but shown eating like they aren’t anorexic, which is also problematic.</p>",

It is not specific to the themes in KPop Demon Hunters (not saying you or Elliot claimed it was).</p>\n<p>There are entire <strong>genres</strong> of films that espouse values that the audience do not live.</p>\n<p>For example, heroic action movies where one person is willing to stand up against injustice/evil/crime/violence, or even grayer action movies where one person is willing to go to extraordinary lengths to rescue someone/get vengeance/etc.</p>\n<p>People love these movies, but most people don’t live values like that. Most people don’t stand up for their values or principles or even their loved ones to that extent. Most people do not experience the extreme scenarios in these stories, but they often don’t even stand up for this stuff to a much less extreme extent that would be relevant in their life.</p>\n<p>Another example: There are detective stories where the detective is obsessed with solving a mystery and finding the truth. They keep pursuing the truth, come into conflict with superiors, and reject convenient falsehoods until they find the real answer. But most people don’t behave that way. Most cops don’t, but also just applied to regular life most people do not try to find truthful answers to problems with that kind of dedication.</p>\n<p>Overall my guess is that a majority of films (and stories in general) promote values that the average viewer/fan of the film fails to live up to.</p>\n<p>Why? I don’t really know, but I have some guesses.</p>\n<p>Fictional stories are often pretty good at creating dramatic, extreme scenarios. These may be totally unrealistic, or they might be realistic but unusual in that most people don’t experience something quite as extreme. They do this for many reasons. A big one is: It’s more exciting and thus captures attention better.</p>\n<p>But another reason is that those scenarios can make conflicts and problems <strong>clearer</strong>. Real life can be messy and confusing. Your personal biases and emotions can get in the way. In fiction, it is often easier to tell what’s going on. Stuff like… Who is the bad guy. Who has positive motives, who is misguided, who is evil. What are the stakes.</p>\n<p>When it isn’t your life, and when so many of the variables are more clearly demonstrated in the story, it can be a lot easier to understand which principles are good and which are bad. But once the story ends and you go back to your real life, it may not be so easy to translate the same ideas. You aren’t a neutral observer. To you, everyone who fucks you over feels like the bad guy, with evil motives. Watching a movie you could e.g. recognize that a bad guy was misguided and deserves a second chance, but in real life you may not be able to see the same things.</p>\n<p>Circling this back to KPDH a little… most people like the idea of being tolerant of differences and nice. When it is demonstrated in a film with an exaggerated scenario, it’s relatively easy to see what’s going on and how to be tolerant. The protagonist is nice and cool, so obviously we should be tolerant of her differences.</p>\n<p>In real life, things are messy.</p>\n<p>Being tolerant of flaws is good, though. And you totally live that value, for example you are tolerant of your dad’s flaw where he says the N word and complains about the Jews controlling the media, because he loves you and he is a good father and grandfather. And you believe being tolerant in general is good, which is why you are so concerned that the younger generation of atheists is so intolerant of Christianity nowadays.</p>\n<p>And obviously, being tolerant is not the same thing as being stupid and self-destructive. The Demon Hunters accepted their friend’s flaws but they still killed the evil demons afterwards. They didn’t just welcome the demons into the human world. You know that wouldn’t be tolerant, it would be stupid and suicidal. And likewise, we can’t just welcome in 100 million illegals the way Biden did, that was stupid and suicidal. We have to get rid of them, because they are evil demons poisoning our country, and if that requires sending ICE into cities, suspending due process, putting the demons in camps, and killing people that try to stop us… well, you know that’s necessary to protect ourselves from this invasion.</p>\n<p>Of course you’re tolerant of flaws and differences. But you can’t be tolerant of demons, obviously. You are tolerant of the flaws of the people you care about, people in your tribe. Because you’re a good person.</p>",

        "cooked": "<p>I have not watched KPop Demon Hunters. I enjoyed this blog post because it raised a question I’ve never thought of before: Why do people like a movie that espouses values that go against how they actually behave?</p>\n<p>I have noticed that I also like some things but don’t always behave in a way that fits that value. Maybe I’m incongruent? Maybe people are drawn to ideals and things they want to be like but currently are not. Aspirational values.</p>\n<p>But in the context of KPop Demon Hunters I could imagine a scenario where e.g. a teen girl watches and likes it, but she’s popular in high school and along with her popular friends bullies a less popular girl who has been deemed weird by them. I don’t know how to reconcile that contradiction. Maybe there’s a gap between the girl’s understanding of the values in the movie vs. the decisions she faces in real life?</p>\n<p>It might also be that movies and media in general make it seem easier to be nice than it actually is in real life. Perhaps it idealizes or romanticizes the actual execution of those values.</p>\n<p>The blog post touches on all of these thoughts I had and more: (below quote from the blog post)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So of course people aren’t great at actually being nice and accepting in the way KDH says to. Even in KDH itself, there are conflicting themes. KDH normalizes a small number of people being ultra-popular while ignoring that some people in the huge audience can also sing well but will never get similar recognition for their talent. And either that’s unfair or else the less popular people have less merit in which case being dismissive of them in some ways is valid.</p>\n<p>KDH normalizes being accepting of flaws from ultra-popular people. It illustrates that. It doesn’t illustrate any regular fans in the crowd having flaws and being accepted anyway. It doesn’t even illustrate people in the crowd with no notable flaws being important, interesting or talented, or getting much attention.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Popularity and status in general are interesting topics to me and I like reading blog posts that touch on them or help me understand them better. It’s true in real life too that many talented people never get famous, while some people less talented than them do get famous.</p>\n<p>Another quote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A important consideration is that if everyone dismisses the same stuff, instead of using independent judgment, then some ideas get a lot of attention while others get none. A million intellectuals have time to investigate over a million ideas. My view is that people should pay more attention to which ideas are have already received engagement. In other words, if someone wrote down a refutation of an idea (and is handling followup questions and criticisms about their refutation), then I don’t need to investigate it myself since it’s already being handled. But if no one is looking at an idea, I should be more open to it. If lots of people had this attitude, then the coverage of ideas that get attention could be better instead of being overly focused on a small number of popular ideas (paralleling how a small number of pop stars get a ton of attention while a lot of other music gets ignored, some of which is actually good).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I was a bit confused by this at first because it said people should pay more attention to which ideas have already received engagement. I interpreted that as prioritizing those ideas or viewing them as worth more attention, analysis, or investigation. But I think the next part about being more open to ideas no one is looking at actually means that people should pay attention to ideas receiving attention so that they can actually focus more on the other ideas that aren’t receiving attention, since they aren’t getting intellectual attention or debate. This way more ideas get worked on and we’d make more progress overall. I find this idea interesting. It’s like each person taking responsibility for intellectual progress. When they see an idea already being handled, they move on until they find one that nobody has picked up, and if it interests them, they pick it up and write about it or respond to it. I like it!</p>\n<p>And near the end of the post:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think there’s something interesting about people who live in a society with tons of meanness and dismissiveness watching yet another movie saying not to do that, and liking it, while knowing that people are going to keep doing it anyway. A lot of the people who like the movie will do the thing the movie says not to do, but instead of being offended they just nod along and agree then don’t act accordingly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is interesting to me too. It also seems really common. It’s like content that shows us what’s ideal and possible and a possible better way of being strikes some part of us that wants to experience that, even if just through a screen temporarily, and maybe we suspend disbelief for a bit even if we might rationally know that the real world won’t meaningfully be different from the values we’re attracted to in the movie.</p>\n<p>Personally I know I’m pretty idealistic but I’ve also grown somewhat jaded from trying to apply the ideals and failing or running into conflicts in life that I didn’t expect. Now I think it’s normal for it to be challenging to live a life according to my values and that it won’t always be easy to make the right choice. Media like this might make it seem unrealistically easy or natural when in reality there’ll be moral dilemmas and internal conflict when it comes to these decisions.</p>",

Some spoilers below.</p>\n<p>One thing I wonder about is how much people pick up on, respond to, or internalize less explicit parts of films like this. If people subconsciously respond less to the explicit parts and more to the implicit parts, it might explain why media that moralizes is not particularly effective.</p>\n<p>For example, when the saja boys are introduced, zoey and mira are shown to be infatuated immediately, they’re then rejected and immediately turn hostile. I don’t think it was the intention of the writers to glorify that pattern of behavior, but that element isn’t really resolved. Arguably it’s still present in the climax since it’s played for laughs. If the roles were reversed it would be seen as incel-type behavior. There’s also some LoLE dynamics to flip the social hierarchy which I think kids will pick up on.</p>",
