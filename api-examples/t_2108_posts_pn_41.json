While no examples come to mind for adults, the fact that some women probably have a harder time because people are trying to develop a trans-dar and mistake them for trans has occurred to me independently and I have sympathy for these women. It’s actually one of the reasons I’m a bit anti-trans. I’m not sure how to resolve that except by doing the thing I’m fighting against which is just treat people based on one’s best guess for how they want to be treated (gender-wise). I think that’s what is wanted, at least.</p>\n<p>One thing I don’t know how to resolve is the parts of trans culture I think are bad for other reasons. Like people basically pretending to be trans to get off and/or do things I’d consider to be sexually assaulting women (e.g., exposing male genitals in female changing rooms). I still think that’s bad but I also don’t think it’s right to demonize a group of people because of a few bad actors (that’s one issue I have with the way the left treats the right, for example).</p>\n<p>I also don’t like the compelled speech aspect of treating misgendering as hate speech. I don’t know the extent to which current laws in various western nations do that, but there are a lot of worrying things like speech laws in the UK and Germany.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"anonymous105\" data-post=\"31\" data-topic=\"2108\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/a/8797f3/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> anonymous105:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If we get sufficient technology to change the gamete expression (e.g. to give an AMAB person ovaries), then we can pivot to something else, like some futuristic gene scan that tells us what their gamete expression was at birth.

The only use cases for it are bad faith, or people who got duped into believing it in good faith and don’t understand it.</p>\n<p>It is a fuzzy concept intentionally to give wiggle room to dance away from arguments without really countering them. What does “organized around” actually mean?</p>\n<p>If it was actually about the gametes alone, the criteria was just “can produce sperm/eggs” then that has a clear objective definition. But it excludes lots of cis people so it’s kinda untenable and makes you look like a jerk and an idiot — basically saying “if you are sterile, you’re no longer a man/woman.”</p>\n<p>I think some far right christian conservatives actually bite the bullet on this, and just say “if you can’t have kids that makes you less of a woman,” so I have mild respect their (evil) principled position.</p>\n<p>But most people know how bad that looks and won’t commit to that. So then you end up in this goofy “organized around” weasel space. But as far as I can tell it is just a proxy for sex characteristics, with a layer of deniability so that if trans people manage to jump the hoops and change their sex characteristics you can say “no you still don’t count.”</p>\n<p>You yourself have betrayed this in our discussion, e.g.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>if not all the roles of the original are fulfilled (including sexual reproduction), then what are they but glorified sex toys?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Looking pretty bad for sterile people.</p>\n<p>I think any specific argument you put forth using this gametes idea will fall on one side or the other… either it will be an argument that focuses on reproduction and also excludes sterile people, or it will be an argument that focuses on sex characteristics and so includes trans people who sufficiently change their sex characteristics.</p>\n<p>So the gametes idea isn’t good. The arguments don’t really work, they just create a sort of interchangeable motte-and-bailey where either side (reproduction/sex characteristics) can serve as the motte or the bailey in any given situation.</p>",

Though given how far we are from that, it’s plausible to me that by the time we reach such an egalitarian society, technology would allow them to fully change biologically in every relevant way, so maybe that’s all it would entail. If we ever reach such a society at all.</p>\n<p>But in the real world, we are nowhere near that egalitarian. Being a man or a woman means a <strong>lot</strong> of things beyond biology. Trans people today are trying to exist in the real world. It isn’t anti-egalitarian to try to exist in the world and be comfortable. It isn’t anti-egalitarian to try to discard gender roles that cause you pain and adopt gender roles that feel more appropriate to you. The choice of “just don’t adopt any gender roles, stupid” is not realistic for most people. Including e.g. you, as evidenced by some of the thoughts you shared.</p>",

Well, no in that the actual facts of the matter are important to me, but I do care about sex characteristics too. I care more about the truth but I’m biased and flawed, too.</p>\n<p>Here’s a bit of a brain dump, maybe TMI but you’ll get more of a sense for my mental state:</p>\n<details>\n<summary>\nbrain dump mental state</summary>\n<p>I think I am somewhat transphobic in a technical sense. I don’t outwardly show disgust (especially around trans people), but I don’t like transness, I don’t think it’s good for the individual, society, or the future of society / civilization and that worries me. I also believe strongly in individual autonomy though and the right for people to live their life how they want, even if that means doing horrible things to themselves. I feel deeply sad for detrationsitioners that regret transitioning, especially when it involved the more irreversible stuff (like bottom surgery). I wish there were more safeguards in the way.</p>\n<p>I also think I have valid points against TRAs. I think pushing trans stuff on kids is objectively wrong and I don’t think that’s transphobic. I don’t think it’s transphobic to advocate for alternate reversible treatments first like therapy that is not affirmation based. I think there’s a lot of medical malpractice going on, and people suffering from gender dysphoria (regardless of whether it’s learnt, induced, or whatever) are pushed into things way too fast and not given proper medical advice, and are treated really badly whichever way they go. I think it’s connected to bigger societal issues. I think people on the left often become trans because it’s a way to fit in – being ‘normal’ isn’t ‘normal’ anymore – and that’s bad.</p>\n<p>I also like feminine women, and like women to be feminine.<br>\nMaybe that’s internalized patriarchy or misogyny, I’m not really sure. Probably a bit of both (I’m less sure about the misogyny though).</p>\n<p>I regret some of what I thought and how I acted when I was younger because I think it wasted precious time (mostly of the women I dated). I don’t like that I contributed to a culture that I think is uncooperative when it comes to long term relationships. I don’t like that I sometimes treated women badly, but I also don’t like that sometimes I was treated badly. I feel like I wasted a lot of time focusing on having sex instead of focusing on trying to find a good long term relationship. I want kids and I am afraid I’ll miss out on having the kind of life I want (incl. a family) because I didn’t take things seriously when I was younger. I’m envious of friends who do have that or are well on the way to it but also glad for them. I feel sad for friends that are half way there and might not make it because life starts so late, now. I think all this is related and maybe being somewhat anti-trans is an outlet for that frustration.</p>\n<p>So yeah you’re probably half right. But I also think you’re half wrong.</p>\n<p>I don’t like that I’m probably a bit transphobic, but I also don’t like the behavior of TRAs.<br>\nI don’t like the violence from the left or how they seem to escalate everything to either being an ally or somehow wanting them dead. I also don’t like that trans people feel like other people don’t see them as people. I think it’s all round a pretty bad situation and is getting worse.</p>\n<hr>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"anonymous105\" data-post=\"25\" data-topic=\"2108\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/a/8797f3/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> anonymous105:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then they typically smuggle sex characteristics back in because the term is “<em>organized</em> around” gametes, so would include associated traits.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>I get the feeling some people definitely want that and use whatever arguments work to further that.

Hopefully the discussion tree helps demonstrate why I don’t see it like that (even internal testes wouldn’t be enough for me to consider them male, since the dominant biological organization (e.g., breasts, wider hips, etc) would still be around large gamete production).</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>It is actually still unclear to me how you would think about such people.</p>\n<p>I also think it is unclear to <em>you</em>. I think you have an intuitive and not fully formed idea that it would be clearcut enough that you would just do so, trivially/easily. I used XY people with total androgen insensitivity earlier because they <em>are</em> a relatively clearcut case. And I do think you could find it easy in other clearcut cases, e.g. an XX non-intersex person who had their ovaries and womb surgically removed.</p>\n<p>But many intersex people have conflicting expressions of biology that are less clear than those examples. I don’t have confidence your guidelines would work well for them. I don’t think you have truly coherent rational guidelines for reliably and easily identifying men and women, and I think the gamete terminology is a similar smokescreen here as when it is used by mainstream anti-trans people. I think your guidelines are actually based primarily on intuition.</p>\n<p>To be clear, intuition can be quite effective. That is what most people use to identify men and women, and it works okay most of the time. But I think it is dangerous to have an intuitive guideline while <em>believing</em> you have a concrete rational guideline. Especially if you use that guideline to start making lots of strong judgments on other people for e.g. the sin of confounding your intuition. Or if you get scared of or angry about gender ideology because gender ideology disagrees with your intuitive preferences. And then, because of that fear/anger, you support government discrimination against gender nonconforming people because of their aforementioned sin.</p>\n<p>I don’t know if you are doing all of those things, but they’re all very common parts of the anti-trans worldview, so maybe they are worth mentioning.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"anonymous45\" data-post=\"26\" data-topic=\"2108\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/a/a87d85/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> anonymous45:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I agree that those kind of characteristic actions make it harder to infer whether someone is male or female (i.e., dominant gamete organization).

Many of these actions have occurred across a wide variety of subcultures throughout much of human history.</p>\n<p>Hormones and surgery make such actions more extreme and effective. That is broadly true when applied to any relevant area, not just gender.

The only way it would be incorrect would be if we define “man” and “woman” as someone’s “genfeelia”, because who the heck knows what they identify as. But if “man” and “woman” mean “male” and “female,” then it is typically trivially easy to identify everyone as one or the other.</p>\n<p>My point was: No, it isn’t. Because trans people exist, you might identify someone as a man, a male, but actually you would be incorrect <strong>by your own definitions.</strong> They are biologically female, but you identified them as male due to their biological/social/psychological traits.</p>\n<p>With that recap, and in light of what we’ve said since, it seems like you agree with my original objection. Trans people make it more difficult to reliably identify who is male or female, therefore it is <strong>not</strong> trivial to identify who is male or female.</p>\n<p>Right?</p>\n<p>–</p>\n<p>Since it seems like that original issue is maybe settled, I’ll engage a bit more and give some more thoughts for future points of contention.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"anonymous45\" data-post=\"26\" data-topic=\"2108\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/a/a87d85/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> anonymous45:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While these might be misleading in some contexts, I think they’re actually pretty minor factors in guessing someone’s gender.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>In isolation, sure, but I wrote that as a list (with a few options) of traits you could see on a single person that might lead you to identify that person as a woman.

Yes, many of those traits are not decisive. But also, many many cis-gendered people have stories of being mistaken for the other gender due to such traits. It happens a lot.

It sort of seems like the logic goes something like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We use XYZ traits to identify men and women</li>\n<li>Some people want to be identified as men or women but we currently identify them the opposite way due to XYZ traits, so they are changing their traits to match</li>\n<li>We want to keep identifying them against their wishes, so we will change which of XYZ traits we say really mater so that we can continue to identify them opposite from their wishes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Like, if social/psychological behaviors are the benchmark, they’ll change those. But then we can say sex characteristics are the benchmark, so they will change those. But now it’s the gamete expression that is the benchmark, so we can continue to not identify them the way they want. If we get sufficient technology to change the gamete expression (e.g. to give an AMAB person ovaries), then we can pivot to something else, like some futuristic gene scan that tells us what their gamete expression was at birth.

Even with our society being more egalitarian than in the past, we are nowhere near a true egalitarian state. There are, again, thousands or millions of ways being a man or a woman can have significant impacts on your life and how you exist in your society.</p>\n<p>A huge number of these are not purely dependent on biology. If you socially or psychologically behave as one gender or another, that has consequences.

I say luckily because otherwise the words become mostly meaningless. e.g., “I’m attracted to women” would cease to be correct for the most people who would say that (and vice versa) if we relaxed the definitions. Most people would need to say something like “I’m attracted to cis-gendered biological females” instead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>This is silly. “I’m attracted to women” does not mean “I’m attracted to <strong>all</strong> women.” There are sub categories of women. You might not be attracted to fat women, or old women, or young women, or smart women, or opinionated women, or hairy women, or tall women. You are attracted to some subset of women. Trans women could be women and all of the above would remain the same. And they might be a subset that often got excluded by many people who say they are attracted to women. That would be fine. It would not require redefining sexual attraction or anything.</p>\n<p>Technically when most guys say “I’m attracted to women” they mean “I’m attracted to women who meet X specific beauty standards”. Also, despite many of their best efforts, such men typically <em>are</em> attracted to trans women <strong>who meet those beauty standards</strong>.

Since psychological and social cues are less associated with gender now and thus not useful in this regard, it only makes sense to ‘fall back’ (as such) to biology/phenotypes to guess someone’s gender. “Falling back” in this case isn’t meant to imply that the examples were <em>good</em> proxies or decisive criteria, just that they were proxies some of the time.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>One other thing that might be worth mentioning is that I think we have different definitions of what ‘man’ and ‘woman’ mean.

It is typically trivial to infer which gamete type a person’s body is organized around.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Your claim has to do with our ability to trivially and reliably assess one’s biological sex, or what gender critical people might say is one’s <em>real</em> gender. Which you say is determined by gametes, but your focus thus far has been on sex characteristics (breasts, vagina).</p>\n<p>So if a “simulation” of an organ could fool you, wouldn’t that interfere with your ability to <strong>trivially and reliably</strong> assess if someone is a man or a woman, by your own definition? You might not believe the simulated vagina is a real vagina, but if your sense organs all believe it is… what then?</p>\n<p>This is sort of like people who say vegan meats or cheeses are not real, and it is easy to tell them apart from real meat and cheese. Which is not really true, at this point in time some vegan meats and cheeses can fool people pretty reliably. But even if it was currently true, we can easily foresee a time when the vegan tech is good enough to do so… there’s no reason to assume such a thing is impossible. So asserting that vegan cheese must not call itself “cheese” would be pretty silly, IMO.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"anonymous45\" data-post=\"24\" data-topic=\"2108\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/a/a87d85/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> anonymous45:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don’t think simulations of organs are organs</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Just to confirm… this means you believe there is a nonzero population of humans who are currently alive and walking around who <em>do not have hearts</em>, right?</p>\n<p>Also, burn/acid victims who have had their faces surgically reconstructed do not actually have faces, right?</p>\n<p>And if we develop cybernetic eyes or hands, we should not properly be calling them eyes or hands.

Do you agree?</p>\n<p>I think this belief is pretty silly. I think an artificial heart or eye or hand or nose that performs the desired functions of the respective organ/appendage should rightly be called by the name for that organ/appendage. Even if some aspects of functionality are a bit different, e.g. people with artificial hearts do not have pulses because the artificial heart pumps blood as a continuous stream.</p>\n<p>–</p>\n<p>Feel free to skip this last part. It is theorizing on your mental state rather than directly arguing with your claims.</p>\n<p>I think you, like most people who care deeply about “trans ideology”, are actually more concerned with sex characteristics than you are with gametes. But gender critical (Edit: I should have said “anti-trans” here instead of “gender critical” — the gamete focus appears in e.g. a Trump Executive Order trying to discriminate against trans people. I don’t think Trump or other anti-trans conservatives could reasonably called “gender critical” though) people have retreated to focusing on gametes after losing arguments on sex characteristics and chromosomes.  Then they typically smuggle sex characteristics back in because the term is “<em>organized</em> around” gametes, so would include associated traits. But by pretending to focus on gametes, you can discount sex characteristics that don’t have corresponding gametes.</p>\n<p>This does mean that some intersex people still must be totally ignored… again, a “biological male” with complete androgen insensitivity will naturally develop a vulva and develop breasts during puberty… but they have no ovaries, no womb, and they have a prostate and undescended testicles. So I think that means their gametes are male, but they pretty much always exist in society as females.</p>\n<p>But it is seen as a fairly effective way to attack trans people from a scientific-sounding position.</p>",

That wasn’t exactly my intention, although I did think that to some extent. It’s obvious to me that access to ID can be manipulated to discriminate against some voters/citizens, but I underestimated the extent to which it can/does happen. I am probably biased also by how easy it is sometimes in other countries, and forgetting that a lot of this is state managed in the US.</p>\n<p>In some other countries there are also laws making it illegal <em>not</em> to be registered to vote. The advantage of those laws is that the govt is somewhat obliged to go out of their way to make it accessible.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"anonymous110\" data-post=\"13\" data-topic=\"2108\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://discuss.criticalfallibilism.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/a/a5b964/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> anonymous110:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There was a Mexican Repatriation that happened in the US in 1930s. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Repatriation\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">According to Wikipedia</a>, between 300,000 - 2,000,000 people repatriated or were deported, and 40-60% of those people were US citizens. Some people are worried that this current push will also end up deporting citizens, since there are US citizens who are not easily able to prove their citizenship.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>I had no idea. The concerns seem a lot more valid now.</p>\n<p>It seems like (today with all the ICE stuff) there’s a good opportunity to help those citizens since there’s now a point of government contact and the current administration could point to procedures that solve the problem for US citizens. (But I haven’t heard about something like this)<br>\nThe govt could also proactively advertise to those people and run special programs or whatever.

There are lots of issues they haven’t solved. One of the issues is that both parties spend a lot of time fighting each other. A lot of people on the left are pretty disillusioned with the democrats, and a lot of people actually argue that the democrat vs republican dichotomy is flawed, because neither one is actually on the side of the people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>My (implicit) point was that when parties complain about something, and are then in power but don’t solve it, then that’s an indication of dishonesty, incompetence, or that an issue isn’t really that bad. I can see how the US federal-state dynamic makes it much more complex though (which I didn’t really consider before).</p>",
